How sustainable are beauty brands really being?,"Lately I‚Äôve been wondering about the beauty industry and its big ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù claims. Almost every brand says they‚Äôre eco-friendly now recyclable packaging, ‚Äúclean‚Äù formulas, reef-safe this, plastic-free that. But when you look closer, it‚Äôs hard to know what‚Äôs actually true.

I recently came across examples where products weren‚Äôt as transparent as they seemed like sunscreens that failed SPF tests or scrubs that quietly use microplastics. It made me think: if this is what‚Äôs happening in one corner of the industry, what does that mean for the bigger picture?

As consumers, we‚Äôre told to trust labels and marketing, but sustainability should mean more than a buzzword. Shouldn‚Äôt brands be held to the same kind of accountability we expect in food or energy?

I‚Äôd love to hear how others here think about this. Do you trust beauty brands when they say ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù? Or do you think we need stricter independent testing and transparency across the board?","I don't trust beauty brands for *any* claims they make, nevermind those outside its field of ""expertise"". || Beauty products fall way out of the actual sustainable universe.  I see so many ads for products that are sold in plastic containers of 30 g  (approx 1 oz) packaging.  It's mindblowing how much packaging is used for cosmetics.  Even if they claim to be recyclable (eg you return the bottle ) we don't know if they really are.  

There are youtube videos debunking the ""clean"" beauty myth as well. It's like the 2000 version of the 90s ""green"" movement.  Some of it is well meaning, some of it is just false and misleading. || These so called ""beauty products"" are inherently unsustainable due to 80 % (if not more) of them doing next to nothing for anyone's actual beauty (or health) - I'd argue many can be even detrimental - so their (however small) footprint is largely unnecessary in the first place. The whole industry is about convincing people that if they use some BS cream they will look like the photoshopped pictures of Hollywood actors (while making you feel bad if you look like mere human being). And the influencers who are happy to advertise about anything as long as they get paid for it are not helping the situation (though their followers are ultimately to blame if they fall for it - but these are often kids)...

Plastic bottle shelters popping up across Africa,"Across sub-Saharan Africa, discarded bottles are being incorporated into quick-to-build shelters.

David Monday founded Pendeza Shelters after losing his home in a flood, and subsequently his brother due to the lack of safe housing.

With support from local masons, the company creates affordable, weather-resilient buildings using plastic bottle bricks (bottles filled with compacted soil), reinforced with iron bars and concrete.

To date, David‚Äôs team has built over 40 plastic bottle structures across sub-Saharan Africa.

Beyond housing, the project also spreads training in waste management and strengthens community resilience.

Has anybody found information on building sustainable small homes with recycled material that takes into account the potential health dangers of using recycled material?,"I have several chronic illnesses and because of those I've realized just how under regulated many fields are related to home building. I tested positive for mold toxicity after moving into a home that had incorrectly remediated water damage. The mold remediation industry has almost no regulation and is absolutely atrocious.

Worst product you‚Äôve purchased while trying to be sustainable,"This is just a small rant. 
Lately I‚Äôve been seeing more products made from post-consumer recycled plastic, which I‚Äôm grateful for. One of these products was trash bags that are made of roughly 60% recycled plastic which I eagerly purchased.

And all I have to say is they suck ass! I‚Äôve had so many rip small holes and lose garbage or dirty cat litter while trying to take them out. One day I emptied my cat litter fully and went to pick up the bag and the entire bottom came undone, the entire seam, leaving me with a pool of cat litter in the bottom of my garbage can.

ADHD and sustaininability,"Hello all! I‚Äôve come to this page for some advice and hopefully some support. I am a huge environmentalist and am in the adjacent career field of natural resource conservation. I care deeply about my impact and try my best to be mindful about my consumption. Having ADHD can make being sustainable difficult sometimes and when my symptoms get bad and I fall short I feel intense guilt and shame. For example, I‚Äôve been trying to cut back on my takeout consumption and meal prep instead, only to buy a ton of groceries and they go bad before I use all of them or struggling to eat leftovers due to food sensitivities or my chaotic schedule. Another example is forgetting my water bottle so I have to consume plastic. It hurts me deeply and makes me feel like a poser of some sorts. I‚Äôm just not sure if anyone in the community struggles with this as well or can give me some tips that work for them. ","Fellow ADHD sufferer here.

We are not special nor exempt from the mutual standards of treating our planet and bodies better. Just want to get that out of the way. A neurotypical person (if such a thing exists) is also subject to slipping into more harmful habits than they‚Äôd like, for any number of reasons; it‚Äôs not the cause that matters but rather what actions you can take to improve.¬†

Treating / managing ADHD means you will navigate this specific stuff better as a result of navigating *all of life* better. Personally I am a 1000% supporter of medication, without hesitation or shame. Those with lighter cases, or people who want to avoid meds, can maybe get by with very strict behavioral adjustments, many of which are well documented.

Treat the cause, and the benefits will propagate to all aspects of life & compound.¬† || First off, stop beating yourself up. There's probably plenty of other ways that you're making sustainability focused actions.

So for food waste, that's not an uncommon thing for some ADHDers and I will say doing more frequent shops can be really helpful, as can having a reliable meals or foods that you can freeze and re-use before they go bad. 

For the water bottle, you might consider having a check list of things to bring with you posted by your door or having a water bottle consistently stay in a bag with you take out. || You know as well as anyone that the reason it is hard for you is because someone is profiting off it. Avoiding plastic? Good freakin luck. It's too cheap, too easy to use, too hard to make a switch. Then, while we are succeeding at reducing things like plastic consumption we are also beating ourselves up for our 5% failure rate.

It's not ADHD, it's the system. You are doing better than can be reasonably expected in a world without water fountains and too little time for ourselves. || Genuinely doing your best along with your physical, financial and emotional capabilities is enough. 

The way the World is built, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to be a ‚Äútrue‚Äù sustainable person. I am a sustainability strategist and have friends also working in different areas of that field, no one feels like they‚Äôre ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù. 

We just do our genuine best, some steps forward, some steps back but keep going. || If you're not one of the world's top 1%, then your influence is very limited anyways. The simplest, most effective thing: go vegan. Even if your entire fridge spoils every day, if it was vegan food, it very likely still cost less area, water and CO¬≤eq to farm than dairy or meat. (Plus the harm to animals is greatly reduced.)

In general I would advise you to take a close look at the impact that different areas of lifestyle changes have. The human brain works in such a way that it tends to equate all of them roughly. Using a bamboo toothbrush, not eating meat, being mindful of plastic waste... When in reality, these things have WILDLY different impact levels, so much that it is - in my opinion - almost laughable to even think about some of these while the bigger ones are not addressed. 

The good news is: the inverse is also true. If you look at your personal CO¬≤ footprint and eliminate the two biggest areas, then you *could* in theory do ten other things, but none of those will have nearly as much an impact, so you can rest assured that you've already done most of what you can.

How can we make sustainable living easier for everyone?,"Been thinking about how living sustainably can be hard for people who don't have much time or money. Things like buying eco-friendly products or reducing waste can feel expensive or complicated. 

What are some easy and affordable ways you've found to live more sustainably? Any tips, idea, or community programs that help? 
","Eradicating car dependency for the majority of the population would make most peoples lives a heck of a lot more sustainable. 

But to do that, car dependent suburbia needs to become a thing of the past. Zoning needs to change. Residential areas need to be mixed use, and walkable. And to be walkable, they need to densify. 

Car dependency is not sustainable, even if everyone was driving EVs

Car dependent suburban sprawl is not sustainable, even if everyone grew veggies in their back yard. 

Living somewhere that you don't need a car is a step towards sustainability, and eradicating that huge expense from your life leaves you with more money to put towards improving your life in other ways.

You don‚Äôt need subways everywhere either. Self-driving buses or even regular buses can fill the gap. The real win is living in a place where you don‚Äôt need a car day-to-day. Rent one for weekends if you want, way cheaper, way greener.
Bonus: this kind of setup doesn‚Äôt have to come with Brooklyn rents. If more places copied that walkable, dense, mixed-use layout, sustainable living wouldn‚Äôt be a luxury, it‚Äôd just be normal.  Or move to Philadelphia.

Does your hairdresser recycle your hair?,"Hi friends! I am helping a UK company and come to the US market with recycling hair. Salons (and beauty in general) are so inherently wasteful and I think it's something we don't think about every day.

What is the hardest thing about trying to live more sustainable?,"Hi all,

I‚Äôve been trying to live more sustainably over the past year, but I keep running into things that feel way harder than I expected, especially with how our economic and consumption systems are set up. I live in the Netherlands, and everything that‚Äôs supposed to be more sustainable or a better alternative always seems to cost more.

On top of that, it‚Äôs a constant struggle to figure out what actually counts as sustainable and what‚Äôs just clever marketing. I also notice how people seem to view sustainability. I get that going fully vegan, never traveling, and living off the grid might be considered ideal, but that‚Äôs not something I want to commit to completely. I love exploring and traveling because our precious world has a lot to offer and to experience, and I also enjoy eating meat now and then, especially when it‚Äôs local and responsibly raised. Finding a good balance without feeling judged is really tough.

How about you? What do you find most frustrating, confusing, expensive, or just plain annoying when trying to live more sustainably? And if you could magically fix one thing, what would it be?","Everything in our society is by default,  unsustainable.

That's the hardest thing, right there. The default, normal mode of existence is hard to break out of. From food, transportation, and laundry, to where you go on vacation. We're all forced into a method of living that will collapse sometime in the next 50 years, and our entire society is only slowly waking up to this.

On top of that, the rich companies that made this happen, will fight us all to the death to prevent any kind of progress on changing our course. || The cost of sustainable options is tough, like you mentioned. Here in the US, you can travel by train (Amtrak) but it's much more expensive than car and usually more expensive than flying. || Living in a car centric society with incredibly limited public transit/bike infrastructure and wide sprawling cities.  
Sure I could ride a bike in a narrow painted bike lane while vehicle traffic flies past at 50+ mph, but it‚Äôs 15 shadeless miles in 90 degree temperatures at this time of year. || I feel like I go through waves where I understand exactly what I need to do and act on it for a couple months but then I get so exhausted with how hard and complicated everything is and go back to the regular way of living for 10 months. Then (on a random day) I picture my kids living in a burning wasteland and asking me how I knew it was happening and chose to do nothing ... And the cycle begins anew. || I live in an apartment. I can't compost or recycle. I have reduced my plastic consumption but damn it sucks that I have to throw aluminum and food away in the trash. It should be available for all apartment complexes. Especially because we have racoons eating our trash at night and squirrels eating during the day. One of these nights it will be a bear and then they will be unalived because they are close to residents. || The hardest thing is living in a society that's not sustainable. 

I live 30 minutes from work with no public transportation available which means I'm burning gas, using oil, etc every single day just to sit at a desk to do what I could do at home. 

There's no amount of paper straws and reusable bags that can make up for the absolutely incredible amount of waste produced by society for zero reason. || For me it's the same inane questions that I get over and over.

Using a bike as my primary means of transportation: ""But what if \[insert highly implausible scenario in which having a large pickup truck is required\]?""

"What's one ""sustainable"" trend you think actually does more harm than good?","I've been thinking about how some eco friendly alternative might not be as sustainable as they seem once you look deeper.

Eg:

‚Ä¢ Paper straw that get soggy and unusable (and people end up tossing more of them)
‚Ä¢ Bamboo cutlery that gets thrown away after one use.
‚Ä¢ Vegan leather made from plastic that sheds micro plastic. 

It feels like we're sometimes swapping on problem for another just to feel better. 

What's a trend or product marketed as ""green"" that you think actually isn't helping it might even be worse? ","We 'recycle' glass containers rather than reusing them.

We take perfectly good, reusable glass containers that can be easily and safely sterilized and relabeled, we shatter them and mix them with a bunch of other colors, ship the remains to some far-off factory to sort and remelt them (using fossil fuel heat), only to make them into a glass container again...

Also, there is no reasonable _need_ for each product to have a different bottle design, so standardize into 3 sizes for each format (jar, bottle). Then you can collect, clean, and refill locally.  

That means instead of shipping around millions of tons of water in Coke bottles, for example, you can just ship the 'syrup', add water and carbonation locally, and distribute last-mile, minimizing emissions. 


PS: No, marketing isn't a _need_, it's a desperate way to 'stand out' when your product can't speak for itself. || Buying ‚Äúgreen‚Äù stuff and feeling good about it instead of consuming less. || The more I heard about it, the more convinced I am that domestic plastic recycling is greenwashing of the highest order. || I see people on various sustainability and ethics focused fashion subreddits wanting to (or actually) throwing out their entire fast fashion wardrobe to then fill it with newly made ""ethical"" and ""sustainable"" clothing. Instead of just, you know, replacing something when it's time to replace it and trying to thrift that thing first instead of just always buying new. Secondhand will always be more sustainable than new and using what you already have is the most sustainable option! || Thinking that it's ok to have highly unsustainable habits because corporations do much worse, so ""the system"" is the problem, not you.

I mean, it's technically the truth but it's such a defeatist and miserable mindset, and it's preventing a lot of people from putting in more effort because""there's nothing they can do anyway"". On this scale it's definitely having an effect. 

I'm so much happier since I reclaimed my power to make my own choices, regardless of what big corps are doing. || KEEP RECYCLING..
STAY POSITIVE!!! || The one that actually irks me the most is reusable water bottles. 

At a high level, the concept is great, love it, happy to have and use one. But the cyclical trend of what the ""cool"" water bottle is actually just gets me and people end up over consuming. 

Vegan leather is also one that irks me because there is an over supply of leather in the market and leather goods *do* tend to withhold the test of time. || [removed] || For me it‚Äôs definitely biofuels, CO2 is CO2 and all of it is currently a problem. It‚Äôs going to be a long time before we are in balance and the short cycle of the biofuels is an option, at the moment every molecule of CO2 is a problem. We need to stop burning stuff! || Listen, I agree that many marketing departments get paid lots of money to find shady ways to convince consumers to feel better about buying their less-than-stellar solution to sustainability. However, your examples aren't the best:

- How do people end up 'tossing more of straws'? And even so, isn't it still better than a plastic straw derived from fossils, which serves a purpose for 10 minutes and then degrades into microplastics that lasts hundreds of years?  

- If you compare bamboo cutlery to single-use plastic, both get thrown away after one use (as the name implies). It's about what happens after, which is natural decomposition for the bamboo (in most conditions), and hundreds of years for the plastic.  

- I don't recall vegan leather ever being passed as sustainable, but yes, it's a cra$py product that doesn't last long and does damage along the way.  

If you're waiting for the perfect solution to come along, you won't be happy at the end. We have to work with imperfect solutions while we slowly make our way away from plastics. || Regenerative/grazing livestock farming. People justify heavy meat consumption, especially red meat, without understanding the actual limitations and environmental impact of different farming methods, particularly when it comes to climate change. Even people who typically buy factory farmed meat will point to regenerative farming to justify heavy meat consumption as if it could ever be implemented at the scale necessary to meet current demand (we would need multiples of the habitable land that currently exists on earth just to meet beef demand) and as if it provides a net benefit for climate stability. Even when actually implemented and not just labeled, so-called regenerative livestock farming (especially of ruminant animals) is still a heavy contributor to GHG emissions while requiring far more land and should not be considered a climate solution. The real solution is to just eat less meat and dairy, especially from ruminants like cows and sheep. || Sustainable trends‚Ä¶ a lot of times the most sustainable thing you can do is continue to use what you‚Äôve got. But this or that new product comes out and people think they have to have it in place of whatever they had before. || if anything i've never seen people give less of a shit about waste and sustainability. for whatever reason this is worse with people from urban areas. 

i own a cafe in a coastal area that in the last 2 years has seen exponential growth as a destination (to vacation and move to) for people from NYC, DC, and NOVA. in the last *six months*  i've had to **double** my garbage capacity because for whatever reason these people always order ""to go"" because they want to eat out of plastic and cardboard boxes and bowls with plastic forks, read the paper or whatever, and then throw it all the in trash. i have no idea why, i assume they think its more sanitary or something? 

i've been trying to think of how to disincentivize this behavior without triggering them and losing business because it is driving me fucking insane. its not even the cost (though this is of course a factor), its more that i find the willful profligate waste to be degenerate. || Replacing something that still works just to move away from something that is seen as bad. E,g. Getting rid of a gas hot water system and replacing with a heat pump when your gas one is still working perfectly.¬†

The world doesn‚Äôt have infinite resources, your gas hot water system used a lot to mine, smelt, manufacture and ship. Use it until it fails then replace with a more sustainable source of power.¬† || Straws are completely unnecessary.  Plastic ones are definitely the worst, as there is no good way to reuse or recycle them.  And in the vast majority of instances the straw is not needed. || The vegan leather thing drives me up a wall. If you want the leather look without contributing to the creation of new leather products, buy pre-owned leather. 

Hell, buy pre-owned in general. || Climate credits. Paying a company to plant trees doesn‚Äôt ever come close to the damage you‚Äôre doing. || Carbon credits/carbon offsets || Some of these, though, are just not going to be equivalent. For example, using a bunch of paper straws is likely still better than plastic straws. Even if the paper isn't recycled immediately, it will still make its way back into the ecosystem so much sooner than any plastic will. Agree on the vegan leather - so maybe avoid needing leather. These are the decisions we make with sustainability, not simply swaps, but reducing consumption and making hard choices to eliminate things from our lives. || ""Clean, natural"" beauty. Natural ingredients are not more sustainable to source than synthetic ones, these products often require delivering from a speciality shop or abroad, and most importantly, they rarely work. So you end up buying more, trying various things just to get disappointed again and again, tossing more plastic packaging, instead of picking up something effective from the

What‚Äôs one small eco-friendly swap you‚Äôve made that ended up having a bigger impact than you expected‚Äîand now you‚Äôre proud of your move?,"I swapped my plastic earbuds for biodegradable wooden ones‚Äîsomething I thought was just a small change. But it turns out, it made me more mindful of the materials I use every day. It feels good knowing I‚Äôm cutting down on plastic waste, even in the tiniest places. Honestly proud of that move.  
What's your story?","Turning your durable plastics into trash is not ""eco-friendly"". It is merely earbuds, so no great harm is done one way or the other, but it is usually better to use the durable plastic item you already *have* than actively discard it for ""sustainable"" options which incur their own carbon footprint (and smog footprint for that matter).

(The exception is something like plasticky clothing which generates microplastics when used or washed, and should be locked into a landfill ASAP.) ||  A cupboard full of used plastic bags, that were too weak to reuse for shopping. That's when I got the reusable ones. It was just before they banned ""single use"" plastic shopping bags.

These days the ""reusable"" single use bags are made of paper, and you have to pay 25cents for them. But supermarkets also sell sturdy reusable bags for $1-2. If you're shopping weekly, why bother with the 25cent ones?

It's got me paying attention to how long things last. Durable things tend to be more sustainable. I want my clothes to last a decade or more, not a single season. 

I'm currently doing an experiment between cheap linen sheets, and significantly more expensive ones. One pair of the cheap ones tore within 2 years of use, they also have a roughness to them that the more expensive ones lack. Staple length is likely to be the issue. The staple is the fibres used to make the thread it's woven from. Short staple means it's rough, and is a weaker fabric. Long staple is smoother, and stronger. The curse is having to buy things online, without being able to feel the product before you purchase, and even when you can, they're often coated in stuff to make them seem smoother, it's not until they're washed that you can tell what they're really like. It's the same with clothes. || I stopped using cotton swabs to clean or dry my ears.

I just wash them with my fingers with face soap in the shower, and then dry them with a towel or let them air dry.

I also switched to 100% plant-based diet, though, that could be seen as a relatively big change for some. || Greatly reduced my meat consumption. 

Switched to an electric car. 

Electrified most appliances - still need to replace furnace and water heater with heat pumps. 

All of that is vastly swamped by the amount of air travel I do for business and personal reasons. I just can‚Äôt give up travel, and I find it distressing. || went vegan (easy)

switched to cycling (harder but worth it) ||    Unfortunately ""Small eco-friendly swaps"" are often just a cover for greenwashing ourselves.  That does not mean they should not be done, but be careful to not use them to convince yourself that you are doing anything significant....if they are all you are doing  In order to make real change, you actually have to make significant changes to the bigger things in your life.  The first step toward that is to learn.  Read articles by real experts, not just opinions from people who don't actually know how to do it (even though that is fun).  If money is a big issue...then start with the things that cost little or nothing, and let the saving that they bring about pay for progressively bigger ones... like readjust your thermostat slightly.  Eat at home, instead of out. Skip the $5 coffee.  Home meals have a tiny footprint compared to driving and restaurants...and no tipping, too.  Eat vegetarian.  It is definitely cheaper than eating meat, and also healthier. Used electric cars are a bargain, and unlike old gasoline cars they are not as prone to breakdowns, and require virtually no maintenance, except tires, and the tiny things that you do yourself like wiper blades, that gasoline car also need.  Learn, in advance, so that when you need to replace something, you can do it in a smart and economical, environmentally responsible way.  Make up for (and take advantage of) the wastefulness of others. Buy your next microwave, TV, clothes, or many other items, recycled at Goodwill or similar stores, and make sure that your good stuff, that you no longer use, also gets recycled. Share/borrow tools. If you know someone who will need to replace their furnace, or AC, or water heater, or even clothes dryer, in the next year (or longer) tell them about the advantages of converting to heat pumps, and the disadvantages of continuing to burn a fossil fuel. It is not impossible for us, in the developed world, to have a carbon footprint that is more like those in the poor countries of the world, even while we live lifestyles that are actually better than most of us live right now.  At our 100 year old house, we (very economically) have a carbon footprint that is 90-95% less than the average American home, and while we definitely did need to do some work to achieve that, it has been, and continues to be, an exiting and fun adventure....at least if you think that learning cool new things and ""living in the future"" (as our neighbor calls it) is fun.

I consider most of this well intentioned but greenwashed. Those pieces are wildly minimal compared to the impact of precious metals being utilized for it. So, I'd focus on those components and making sure they are apart of a circular economy or coming from a source that has low impact. Eliminating plastic is noble, but in this capacity as a high end product, more or less negligible. Additionally, where is this repurposed wood coming from, is their emissions that are tied to that process that are in access of plastic? 

What would get me to purchase it would be that combined with other efforts. Paying staff a livable wage, promoting sustainability and donating a portion of sales to an organization vetted to actually do good with it, having a warranty that includes repairs and allows for self repair (buying less of them over time), and jumping into b-corp certification (though this takes a lot, but aligning with the principles is a first step.

How do you spot and avoid greenwashing when shopping eco-friendly products?," So many brands these days are slapping ""sustainable"", ""natural"" or ""eco"" on their labels, but how do we know what's actually legit? 

What red flags do you look for when evaluating a product or company's sustainability claims? Are there any certification, tools, or resources you rely on to verify whether something is truly environmentally friendly or just clever marketing? ",">What red flags do you look for when evaluating a product or company's sustainability claims?

The first big one is if anything calls itself ""green"" it's typically a marketing/advertising ploy. I work in corporate sustainability with consumer goods and this was an ongoing battle with category managers and marketing. Green doesn't mean anything on a whole. 

I'm also wary of anything that is single use that claims to replace another product. 

As for certifications, there are a few that are relatively rigorous which indicate to me that even if it's not as sustainable as I may want, they are making the right steps:

* B Corp

* Cradle to Cradle

* OEKO-TEX

There's also plenty of very strict legislation coming out such as the EU Green Claims, which *should* mitigate some of it. || Look at what they actually claim:

Sustainable - they claim nothing

Green - they claim nothing

Eco friendly - they claim nothing

100% recyclable - better than nothing, but not by a lot. They don't claim anyone will recycle it, most materials cost more to recycle than they are worth, but they claim it is at least theoretically possible

Made of 100% recycled ingredients - finally an actual claim that represents they did something green worthy. 

The more they claim that they actually did something tangible to less likely to be greenwashing. Of course they could be lying but this comes with stiff penalties if anyone ever figures it out, which they eventually will. But claiming something is ""green"" isn't either lying or true, its just poorly defined. || Buy it in person at a store that you trust that helps you vet such things.  If it‚Äôs being sold on Amazon or Walmart, it really doesn‚Äôt matter what the label says. || Any organic product you buy needs to show their certificate, updated at least yearly, through whatever rating agency they go through. I know not enough people ask for this because I've bought organic cotton from a few different companies that DID have their certificate, but didn't bother linking to it on their website because no one ever asked. I've also stopped myself from ordering from 'organic"" companies that could not product a certificate, or that linked to a certificate that did not have their name on it. || Generally the more a product touts it's eco-friendliness the more suspect I get.

Just using the term raises my eyebrows.  The term doesn't really have a definition. And it's mostly just PR from people that claim it for their products. And consumption itself isn't particularly eco friendly.

Durable goods manufactured close to home from easily recycled materials, with the fewest moving parts to work effectively,  preferably with no plastic parts or packaging ,is my guide.  Even better if I can find the item used. || [removed] || I don't even care what they claim.

Which tooth brush to use??,"Hey everyone. I need a new toothbrush and would really like to buy a bamboo head and body. But recently my mother got gum disease and her dentist recommended her to buy the electric oral b toothbrush with the round head. Her plaque has significantly decreased and her dentist recommended that everyone in the family get an electric toothbrush. I understand that oral health is important but I don't want to be brushing microplastics onto my teeth. Then there's the obvious waste issue as well, electronic and plastic. 

I guess really it's a toss up between microplastic avoidance or going by the dentists intruction. I know that microplastics are unavoidable, we literally breathe them in every day, but every step counts. I suppose I've already made my decision really, opting for the bamboo instead, but I'm curious as to what your thoughts are. Also has anyone used toothpaste tablets insteadnof paste from a tube? ","Honestly I‚Äôd say go with the dentist recommendation.  
  
When it comes to making individual environmental changes we should be triaging to focus on the most impactful changes available to us within our means.   
It might be an unpopular opinion, but some choices are too small to sweat. Save your resources and mental/emotional capital for more meaningful action. || Personally when it comes to health purchases. Unless there's a significant discrepancy between emissions impacts I'll opt for the DR. recommendations. To me the potential health risk is not worth the minor improvement regarding emissions and waste. || I've been to dental shows where they just give away free electric toothbrushes to dentists, dental nurses etc. 

I do think they're somewhat bought into promoting certain brands. || Actually I'd go with Waterpark style for prevention and gum massage || As far as brushing plastic into your teeth, it is my understanding that even bamboo brushes have plastic bristles. I could be wrong but I don‚Äôt think there is a way to avoid some level of plastic. Honestly in this case, the best preventative care, even if it is plastic tooth brush, is less waste than the waste of treatment for any restorative work from cavities. Only you can decide what feels right to you but sometimes self care and health has to come at the cost of what is more environmentally friendly. 
And as far as tooth paste, I really like using an essential oil blend from healthy mouth but it is a personal preference and the oil is an acquired taste || Look up Suri toothbrushes. Sustainable electric toothbrush brand. Their replacement heads are made of biodegradable material. I'm switching to it soon because I don't need a Bluetooth electric toothbrush.

Saving clothes?,"Do you think it is more sustainable to 
1. Save big sisters clothes for new sister (daughters are 5 years apart so would be saving a long time)
2. Consigning/donating to friends 5 year old daughters clothing and then repurchasing from consignment/receiving hand me downs for younger daughter when she needs new sizes.

Ideally I‚Äôd donate 5 year olds clothing to friends then get it back to save for younger sis, but realistically that won‚Äôt happen.

I feel like it‚Äôs a long time to save them and the clothes sitting unused.","I'd pass them on. Who knows, you may get some back from them, eventually too!!

Sustainable semi-rural living?,"We are considering to move out of a large city (issues of criminality, pollution, downward spiral of institutional neglect) to a rural area at 10km from the nearest city. 

But sustainability is very important to us. So, I want to pick your brains on whether we are missing an aspect when we think about organizing our lives.

\- commute would be by electric bike (schools are close by; work mainly remote and otherwise by bike).

\- locally sourced vegetables and fruits (part own produce, part from local farms); we eat vegetarian.

\- shopping 1x a week by electric car, charging with solar panels and home battery.

\- less food waste & consumerism: now we eat out often & buy food on the go (more plastics)

\- house eventually heated via heat pump, with necessary isolation (but, similarly to current home in the city, not net-zero).

\- co-housing with parents (also ++ care for children & for them later)

I know rural living is less sustainable because of transport & infrastructure issues, but by doing everything by bike & contribution to our own food production we hope to mitigate this. What am I missing?","Rural living isn't really sustainable, not unless you're within a short distance of a town, even a 15 minute bike ride is probably the outer limit of practical for most people.

If schools are close enough for cycling, why aren't supermarkets or grocery stores?

I grew up in rural Australia. My childhood was spent on a farm, where my mum grew almost everything we ate. Gardening and cooking were her full time job. It was about 8km to the school bus stop, and about 20km to town where the school is. 

We moved to town when I was 10. That was a more sustainable place to live. I could walk to school, and the main street was within walking distance. When I got a job, I could walk to that too. 

EVs are really just greenwashing car dependency. Tyres still cause a lot of microplastic pollution, and being a heavier type of vehicle, they wear the tyres even more. 

Living somewhere that you can walk, ride a bike, or use public transit will always be more sustainable than living somewhere car dependent. 

If you want to reduce your food waste and consumerism do it now, before you move anywhere. Change your habits. 

Learn to cook like an Australian shearers cook: adapt your recipes to use what you have got rather than worrying about what you're missing. I'm pretty sure that's how lamingtons, pumpkin scones, and fairy bread came into existence. || I don‚Äôt know where you are, but if you‚Äôre looking for less neglect and less criminality‚Ä¶ rural America ain‚Äôt all sunshine. An urban lifestyle is more sustainable. || One aspect that you are missing is the higher impact of dispersed distribution - even if your means of getting to the market actually are sustainable, sending goods to hundreds of rural markets is less sustainable than sending them to a handful of urban markets. Then there are the embedded costs - all of the material and energy needed to manufacture the car, a home that is likely larger than you actually need that could potentially be used by people who actually utilize the rural land for their income and to generate goods for others¬∞, etc. Rural living also requires more everything per person - more road, longer utilities, etc.  And if the choice does necessitate the use of an automobile, even if it's an EV, then that alone largely moves you outside of the realm of sustainability¬∞¬∞. As the old saying goes: saying that EVs are better than ICE vehicles is like saying that solid turds are better than diarrhea. While that may be true, they're still both shit. 


That having been said, what you're describing is nonetheless more sustainable than the lifestyles of most people in developed nations (admittedly, not a high bar). However, it's not scalable. Maybe you can work out a way for it to be sustainable. But with 8 billion people on the planet, the rural approach ain't a large-scale option. Collectively, the most sustainable approach is, with the exception of those who actually work the land for the benefit of themselves and many others (i.e. farmers), we all strive to embrace population density. 


A couple of side notes:  1) When you aggregate crime stats with vehicular altercations, your rural ideal may be more dangerous than the urban alternative. Per capita crime does tend to be higher in urban areas than suburban ones, but vehicular injuries and deaths are higher in suburban areas, to such a degree that you're less likely to be harmed by crime or vehicles in urban areas than you are tu be harmed by crime or vehicles in suburban areas. It is likely that a similar effect is at play in rural areas. 2) Jane Jacobs was right - eyeballs on the public spaces do decrease crime. When you compare neighborhoods of similar socioeconomic status, the more car-centric they are, the higher their per capita crime, because motorists are disconnected from their surroundings, while pedestrians and cyclists are not.  If enough civic minded people such as yourself embrace urbanism as a matter of principle, then the result will likely be a reduction in urban ailments. Most current urban ills are a direct result of the War Against Cities that was initiated by the Eisenhower administration, and the corresponding disinvestment and abandonment by people such as yourself.  Don't run away (even if you do so in a sustainable manner) - stay and fight to allow urban development to attain its destiny as THE solution. 


¬∞Admittedly, this may well be unlikely for your plot o' territory. But there could also be a trickle-down impact - your purchase prompts someone who otherwise would have bought your property to instead buy some farmland further out.


¬∞¬∞There are massive embedded costs with any 2- to 5-ton machine, particularly EVs. EVs do require less maintenance than ICE vehicles, but they do require some. And they do use the same tires as ICE vehicles. The tires. The tires! Oh, THE TIRES! Not only is their disposal a major environmental issue, but tires are likely THE biggest source of microplastics in the ocean (the Pew Charitable Trust estimates that 70% of ALL microplastics in the ocean come from tires). And, while EVs are more efficient than ICE vehicles, they nonetheless do use massive amounts of energy. Even if you're charging them with solar, if you had to increase the number of solar panels that you need, you have to factor in the embedded cost of those additional panels. And if you're connected to a grid that doesn't solely use sustainables and that doesn't bar household contributions to the grid, then the power that is going to your EV is power that otherwise could have gone back to the grid to make it less unsustainable. Then, of course, is the massive amount of land that is wasted when we design around the needs of automobiles rather than people. Cars take up a massive amount of space, so much so that most places demand that more land be devoted to parking - the temporary storage of automobiles while they're not actually being used - than is actually occupied by retail or office buildings. That's fucked up. And if you rely on a car, then you're voting with your wallet in favor of such absurdities. || I think you underestimate the amount of transportation you need. 

What about the kid(s)? It's not only school, but they will want to play with friends, do sports etc. 

How are you going to arrange these logistics? Prob not only with e-bike, if you guys also work. Other parents definitely aren't going to bring their kids to your place by bike, so need to drive to your place. 

So, probably you'll need the car more than you anticipate now. 

And how healthy is the rural area you are going to live? What crops do they grow there? Pesticides is a huge issue also for your health, only recently receiving more attention. || Just to mention, nobody has pointed out that urban sustainability is a lot lower than we typically see using the questionable per-capita framework. 

250k people worth of city is a tremendous source of pollution and user of energy, but per-person it doesn't look so bad. We don't have a plan to sustainably keep those kinds of dense groups of people around as the cheap plastic and fossil energy run out and the aquifers keep draining, and from a certain perspective city/urban living is fundamentally unsustainable. 

You can't have the city without the farmers just like you can't have unsustainable industrial beef without the unsustainable industrial alfalfa.

Highly affluent rural living - driving into the city frequently and producing thousands of watts of solar power, for instance - is going to be unsustainable, but so is affluent urban living. The most sustainable possible living - a population on a landscape that can actually support it, no imports required- is going to look much more rural than it does urban.

Living a high-resource consumption lifestyle is unsustainable if you do it in the city or the country, but cities all over the place just isn't something that the biosphere can handle. Every city needs a whole lot of rural to keep it alive, and we're already way past the limit on both types of land use. || It's not more sustainable but it sounds like you guys are quite committed

One thing I would look into is solar, if your climate allows

Also, a big offset would be planting native as much as you can. || We moved in with my dad 18+ years ago. We have a big garden, solar, water cistern, rain barrels, a well, and raise poultry for meat and eggs and sheep and goats for meat.¬†


Yes, there's a lot of driving. But, we eat probably at least 40-60% of food raised, grown or harvested on the farm.¬†",29,sustainability,2025-06-30 19:01:45,sustainable semi rural living,considering move large city issues

Country that is best for sustainable living,"Crossed my mind about relocating in the next couple of years.

Ideally, I'm looking for a country where things like clean public transport, access to nature, recycling, renewable energy and low waste living are just part of everyday life. I also care about community focused living, not just the ""green tech"" side of things.

I know places like Sweden, Denmark, and New Zealand often get mentioned, but I'd love to hear from people who've actually lived in sustainable-minded countries. Is it easy to integrate into? Are the values reflected in daily life or just government policy? 

Any underrated countries I should be looking at? 
","From what I've heard, New Zealand lacks in public transport. 

The Netherlands is the pinnacle for cycling as an alternative to cars. They also seem to have good transit.

Germany is good on recycling, Freiberg is a pretty green city [https://youtu.be/6Vil5KC7Bl0](https://youtu.be/6Vil5KC7Bl0) 

Europe in general seems pretty good for sustainable living. 

My state in Australia ticks some of your boxes, depending on where you are in the state. We're nearing 100% renewable energy. Adelaide has a lot of transit, and people of all classes use it. You can access national and conservation parks via public transit, and linear park runs through multiple suburbs, from the foothills to the beach, via the city centre, it's got walking and cycling trails for the whole length. Rubbish collection includes recycling and green waste, and those bins are typically larger than the rubbish bins. We're also pretty big on reducing water waste, kinda have to due to being the driest state on the driest continent and all that. || You should probably look at the immigration requirements of those countries and see whether you meet them first. || Main consideration is visa. 

Can't always just up and move to another country unless you are highly skilled in your field. || I live in Slovenia and I think that compared to many other European countries we're doing alright sustainability-wise. Public transit is ok (in larger towns, mediocre between towns), access to nature is truly unrivaled and we're extremely proud of it, everybody recycles (it's mandatory), there's a lot of emphasis on local produce... But I'm not qualified to dive into legal policies and compare countries in that way. || I tend to take a more collective view of sustainability and think it‚Äôs more your responsibility to try to improve systems of sustainability where you are than to move somewhere that already has them. That being said good public transit and access to nature are great quality of life things that I definitely also prioritize when deciding where to live and it‚Äôs totally reasonable to prioritize stuff like what you‚Äôve listed in choosing where to live. || I heard Costa Rica is a nice place to live and has 99% renewable energy. || Vancouver Canada is fairly good. || If you're adopting the lifestyles of people who live there, then the poorest countries are the best. But I don't think that's what you're asking. || You're asking about entire countries, and have named a couple.

Might be worth being more specific in your search. There may be parts of the UK or USA that meet your needs.

Anyone else feel scared when trying to switch to a sustainable lifestyle?,"I‚Äôm in my 20s and am opening my eyes to the consequences of the habits that I, and so many others, engage in. Meat, single use items‚Ä¶ I really want to make a change to benefit the world in as small of a way as I can. But it does require surrendering the comfort and convenience of life. Would I be happier eating steak and fried chicken all the time? Obviously. I think a lot of people would,
but you have to let that go since it‚Äôs the right thing to do. And that‚Äôs scary. I think part of it is losing the innocence of being young when you didn‚Äôt have to worry about those sorts of things. So these are feelings of growing up as well. It‚Äôs also because it‚Äôs switching up such familiar habits and flipping them over because it‚Äôs such a big culture shock. It‚Äôs also a little scary because when I was a kid I didn‚Äôt have to worry or be aware of these problems in the world, and that‚Äôs a great privilege that I miss. And I think a lot of people ignore these things or pretend that they don‚Äôt exist so they‚Äôre able to live without the stress. Did anyone else face these feelings when opening their eyes to these problems and making these changes. 

It‚Äôs also tough because I‚Äôm a huge picky eater, even with animal products, I don‚Äôt like most meats or veggies. It‚Äôll be a slow process but I‚Äôm ready to really try ","A fully sustainable lifestyle is indeed a scary thought.  Personally I don't want to live in a hut, grow my own vegetables and knit my own clothes.

 Neither do I want to forgo the advantages of having a healthcare system, infrastructure, army etc.

Also, plastic bags are really useful.

HOWEVER

1.  By never eating beef ( pork, chicken, fish or veggie instead), I have HALVED the climate impact of the food I eat.

2.  By fully insulating my house and turning the thermostat down to 18C I have HALVED the impact of heating my house.

3.  By often buying things used instead of new I have greatly reduced the impact of my spending.

4. By walking or cycling locally and reducing the distance I go on holiday I have greatly reduced my impact from travel.

5.  By voting and campaigning for a party that cares about the environment, I have shifted politics in a good direction. 

TLDR the biggest wins are actually quite easy || Yes, definitely. Relish the struggle. It‚Äôs not going away. Feel proud of your accomplishments. Don‚Äôt be hard on yourself and forgive yourself any moments of weakness (there may be many or prolonged moments and that‚Äôs ok; this is a long game. || Switch from scared to proud. You are making a change that your family did not even know it was necessary. You are doing for yourself, for the animals and for the world.

Focus on the big things first, a reusable fork is easier than a vegan diet but it is clear that reducing if not removing completely meat and dairy is the way to go if you really want to reduce your overall CO2e emissions.

Most importantly, take it easy! You will feel overwhelmed, it's normal, almost everyone will go through it. Enjoy it, celebrate goals, spread your success!

You will hear a lot of judgement and stupid comments,  help them understand why and have open discussions, sometimes it will work, sometimes the response will be worse, at a certain point, fuck them!

Good luck and take it easy :)

Ps: on being picky on veggies.. it is common especially if you were raised on a non Mediterranean diet, embrace it by cooking nice recipes and hide the veggies you don't like in other shapes and forms. I love veggies but I know a lot of people who can be very difficult, it's an exercise || Be realistic about the fruits of your efforts.

A lot of people spend an inordinate amount of time splitting hairs and measuring little pieces of plastic when they could do something much more valuable, but instead focus excessively on the wrong things.

Reducing red meat, living in a smaller urban space, not flying around the world on vacation is going to help a lot more than 70 years of avoiding paper plates and plastic forks. 

Once you start to really prioritize, you can feel like your effort is worth doing. The truth is, AI is here and our energy situation is fu-- just making a picture of a bird is like driving across town, so educate yourself and go for the things that matter instead of the things that make us ""feel"" like we're ""doing something."" || Honestly, just start small. Before I buy things, I think do I really need this? How often will I use it? How long will it last? These questions have reduced my urge to buy things significantly. My wallet is happier, I like the things I do have much more, and I‚Äôm able to save for higher quality, Buy It For Life products.

I try to repair things when I can. I try to learn skills and grow my hobbies. When I knit a sweater, I take better care of and love it way more than any I‚Äôve ever purchased.

Sometimes being sustainable does stress me out, especially regarding food. I want to be a vegan, but I‚Äôve always struggled with trying new foods. It‚Äôs a work in progress, but I‚Äôve actually found some substitutions I like MORE than meat. Like eating curry with Paneer (a type of cheese, similar to tofu that it soaks uo other flavors very well) instead of chicken. I used to hate salads, but I actually really like them now and my body craves them at times. Sofritas at Chipotle are pretty dang good.

I also switched out my cleaning products for Blueland, who sells refillable bottles and tins. They are Cradle to Cradle certified, so they‚Äôved looked at the entire lifecycle of the product for sustainability. It‚Äôs not that much pricier than regular cleaning products and they don‚Äôt use harsh chemicals like bleach and ammonia. Super easy switch, cute packaging, and has not negatively affected my life in any way. It actually feels kind of lux tbh. || It definitely can be scary, but you get used to a new normal! There‚Äôs tons of other benefits to sustainable actions too, like exercise from walking/biking or saving money by buying used. You can also start with smaller, easier changes and add more later on! That way you‚Äôre not overwhelmed and can stick to whatever you decide to change || Lol no. I feel scared not doing so || The only aspect that is remotely scary is change itself. Eating is one of my favorite activities (I'm part plague of locusts, on my father's side), so becoming vegan had its initial challenges. But once I weaned myself off of junk food, my palate became more sensitive to the astounding variety of vegetables and fruits, and I enjoy eating more than ever. Eating nothing other than whole vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, etc. is also a lot cheaper than an omnivorous diet AND, since it's (generally) less calorie dense, I can eat more! (I also feel far better and am in better shape in my 50s than I was in my 20s.¬∞)

Giving up a car is the keystone of any lifestyle that is remotely sustainable, and that can be challenging if you're cursed with living in a Second World country such as the US. But finding a way to do without a vehicle in a society that essentially tells non-motorists to go fuck themselves can actually be a fun challenge. And it's far more enjoyable to walk, bike, or take transit than it is to drive (and dumping the automobile is the other reason that I'm in better shape in my 50s than I was in my 20s¬∞).

In a world in which you can borrow books, CDs, DVDs, and such from a library, use a phone to listen to music and watch streaming videos, etc., and when almost any material good that you want can be found at a thrift store, consumerism is nothing more than a disease - it is likely to yield suffering, but is almost guaranteed not to deliver lasting pleasure. 

¬∞For the record, in case you're assuming that I must have been incredibly out of shape in my 20s, I was never athletic but my fitness level was above average, and I was an avid backpacker and my primary mode of transportation in college was a bicycle. It's simply that, by adopting a plant-based, whole foods diet and giving up the car (and while remaining too lazy to go to a gym), I have been able to attain a more natural and innate level of

What's the biggest myth about sustainability you wish people would stop believing?,"There's a ton of advice and ""green"" trends out there, but some of it feels misleading or even counterproductive. For example, the idea that buying eco-friendly products alone will save the planet, or that going zero waste is easy for everyone. 

What's sustainability myth or misconception that really grinds your gears? Maybe something you've seen in your country, or media? How do you separate genuine impact from greenwashing or hype?

Also, what do you think people should focus on instead? Individual habits, systemic policy changes, tech innovations or something else entirely?

Sustainable transportation for daily commuting?,"Hello everyone,

I definitely do not have a lot of knowledge on sustainability and how to be environmentally friendly, but I'm really interested in learning more and being more aware. I'm at about that time in my life where I should start looking into getting my own vehicle, but I of course have concerns about my impact on the environment. 

I'm wondering what the best means of transportation is overall while still being affordable and eco-friendly. I live in an area that is not very walkable and doesn't have a lot of bike lanes or options for public transportation other than the bus. Even though I plan on trying to take advantage of the aforementioned options as much as possible, I'm wondering if there are any vehicles that are practical and still environmentally friendly? Are mopeds, for example, a better means of transportation in that sense? Or electric bikes/scooters? 

Sorry in advance if these are dumb questions. Like I said I really just want to try to be more aware of my impact in my day to day life. Any insight is much appreciated.","In order of Eco-friendlyness

\- Walking/biking

\- E-Biking

\- Public transport

\- Carpool

\- EV

\- Plug-in hybrid (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle or PHEV) assuming overnight or workplace charging is available. If charging is not available and you end up using it exclusively in HEV mode, its actually less efficient than a non-plug-in HEV. 

\- Hybrid (HEV)

\- Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) car

I haven't looked into e-bikes vs. mopeds in a few years, but last time I did e-bikes won over ICE mopeds in fuel and maintenance costs. E-Bikes are also easier to use if you live in an apartment since you bring the battery in with you to charge every night instead of having to stop at a gas station.

Job type and company culture makes a difference in transportation choice. If you are the employee opening a store/restaurant you need to be on time and sometimes walking/biking/public transport make that difficult. In the USA a lot of managers also require you to be exactly on time or early for positions where being a little late and staying a little late to make up the time would make no difference to the business, which discourages people from walking/biking/public transport even though those options are cheapest. If you live in a more sane culture, that isn't as much of an issue.

Owning or leasing an EV is very easy if you own a home, but more difficult if you own a condo or rent. Overnight charging at multi-family properties is still uncommon in most of the world. Even if your complex has charging options, what if you own an EV and have to move to a different complex without charging options? I sold EV chargers to businesses and multi-family properties so for anyone reading this PLEASE ask your landlord to install EV chargers and ask about EV chargers whenever you are apartment hunting, so multi-family owners will realize there is a demand for EV charging. As much as I am an advocate for EVs, I can't recommend them to anyone who does not have at-home charging figured out.

PHEVs are a lower risk than EVs because they still work if you don't have at-home charging figured out. If you owned a PHEV and had overnight charging at your apartment, then had to move to a place without overnight charging, your vehicle would still be fine. || There was a shower at my work. So I rode my bike and took a shower and started work. Carbon footprint, a banana, cereal, coffee, and yogurt. || This is not a dumb question; it‚Äôs something many people struggle with, especially Americans, who often live and work in places that are super inaccessible except by car üòÇ

While others can offer better advice on a vehicle, I would suggest that no matter what you go with, consider joining or forming a carpool for your workplace. Everyone saves on gas (and potentially parking costs), you can have either some nice conversation or a little downtime at the beginning and end of the day, and it‚Äôs better for the planet. It‚Äôs insane how many vehicles on the road are carrying one single person (think: the vast majority). If you live somewhere with HOV lanes, that‚Äôs an added perk. :) || If the thought of riding at slower-than-traffic speed on bike lane free roads is a concern, a second hand motorcycle is an option. There are a lot of low mileage learner sized bikes (4 stroke 250cc in my area).

Sure, they're still (mostly) ICE. In their favour, they contribute little to traffic, little to parking issues, cheap, low fuel consumption and no new materials are consumed in their manufacture. || Depending on your commute and ebike may be viable. You can ride on the road, and be very safe.¬† || The general hierarchy is going to be human powered > battery powered > ICE powered. But obviously there are significant tradeoffs for each: bikes/scooters are very efficient but not always safe/convenient/feasible; cars can be extremely convenient but they're expensive and more polluting; electric cars and plug-in hybrids are generally better than conventional ICE cars but are also more expensive and may not be doable with your budget, etc. 

If you can get by without a car, great. If you need a car, get the most fuel-efficient one you can reasonably afford. A $12k used Mazda3 that gets 41 mpg highway plus a $1k bicycle, electric scooter, etc for zipping around town might be a better option than a $15k Toyota Prius that gets 52 mpg.

"Is ""fast furniture"" the new fast fashion problem?","In 2025, cheap furniture that breaks quickly is becoming a big waste issue. Kind of like fast fashion. A lot of it ends up in landfills, and it's often made from low quality, non recyclable materials. What can we do to make furniture more sustainable? 

Let's talk about how to stop furniture from becoming the next environmental problem. ","Yes. But its  less about fashion and more about being in poverty and needing a shelf unit, as far as what ive seen. || This has been an issue for decades my friend. Gets more sinister when you look into the sources for the wood for all of our favourite furniture brands (old growth forests in eastern Europe be gone, we need new hundred dollar coffee tables every two years to fit the new trend). || In the UK most rental properties are furnished. In the US, as a renter you don't know how long you'll be somewhere so the incentive is to buy cheap and not even bother moving it. We live in a big apartment complex and every weekend there is a bunch of furniture in the dumpster from people moving out. || Is ""cheap everything, and planned obsolescence"" the underlying problem? 

Yes. When manufacturers deliberately build things as cheap as possible to be replaced quickly so they can sell more stuff, that is exactly the problem. It's nothing new, and it's baked into late stage capitalism. || It's an older problem than fast fashion. Ikea has been pumping out super-cheap crap for at least 30 years. To be fair, they make good stuff too but 99% of the time, people choose the items with the lower price points and they don't hold up and can't really be repaired or recycled. 

Don't buy crap, that's all. This isn't yesterday's news. It's 30 years ago's news. || It‚Äôs the most awful th8ng.  Over the years and thanks to real estate investing being the hip new thing. 1/3 of the houses in my neighborhood that used to be owned, are now rented and turn over frequently.  The amount of crap piled up on the street anytime someone moves is so depressing.  Or the amount of times the same people buy things that used to be durable like mattresses, sofas, chairs, tables and shelving.

What Was Your First Step Toward a More Sustainable Lifestyle?,"Mine was switching to a reusable water bottle. I know it sounds small, but that one change opened my eyes to all the single-use plastic I was going through. It wasn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit was about starting somewhere.

It was easier and cheaper, and made me question: what else was being sold to me as the default when in fact there were easier, cheaper, and more sustainable options available? || Trying to reduce how much trash I throw away. || Converting to eating plant-based.  It makes so much sense when you look at the resources used in production. And it was such an eye-opener to see that meat and other animal products was just not necessary.  

We did this slowly and gradually, and always thought that if we can't go without one animal-based ingredient or meal,  then we just continue with that and drop everything else. 

But in the end, there was nothing we couldn't happily live without. || Getting solar panels, driving a 16 yr old Prius, using recycled paper towels and TP, not eating animals, not buying new things || Not eating meat, and now raising my children to not eat meat. || Becoming vegetarian ü•ï || Got rid of my car and now walk/bike/take transit instead. || Handkerchiefs || I cut beef out, since that‚Äôs one of the most impactful changes you can make. 

Then I started making small steps like ‚Äúif I have meat for lunch I won‚Äôt have it for dinner‚Äù etc.  

Now I have quite a lot of things I do that I think are more impactful than things I used to think efe impactful. I buy nicer clothes now and aim to repair them. I learned to darn and I‚Äôm learning to repair clothes more. This has stopped my replacing clothes already.

City or rural - Which supports a greener lifestyle?,"Hey everyone. I've been thinking a lot about sustainability lately. Some say living in the city is better for the environment because of public transport and smaller living space, while others argue rural living is more connected to nature and inherently greener. What's your take? Which lifestyle is truly supports a greener, more ethical way of living?","Due to economies of scale cities have a much higher sustainability ceiling than rural living does.  
Unfortunately cities are often horrible places to live for those who want to feel connected to nature. || I‚Äôm a city dweller. I almost always just walk and bike to everything, and waste less food because I just buy what I need a 5 minute walk away at the store. I rarely have to turn on heat or AC to heat or cool my apartment, and my city is filled with parks and parkland, consistently topping national rankings. The parks system is integrated into the bike and trail network so everyone has access. The bike network in my city is first-class, consistently rated among the best in the country. We‚Äôve been here 3 years and still only scratched the surface visiting local parks. We find lots and lots of quality items at local thrift stores because there‚Äôs so many people, and there‚Äôs lots of local groups to get involved in to make a bigger impact than you can on your own. If you‚Äôre intentional about where you end up in a city, you can find a good balance between sustainable living and access to nature. I went through many maps and sifted through hundreds of apartment listings to figure out the perfect balance for me and my family. 

I‚Äôve also done rural living, but I felt like I was normally viewing all the natural settings around me through a windshield. During the summer, I was able to do some nice bike rides and do a beach day or something, but I was out of luck during the winter, as they didn‚Äôt plow the bike lanes or paths, which isn‚Äôt an issue in the city I live now. I lived there for many years without a car and it was really tough, and I had to take Ubers a lot as the transit system was bad and the bike infrastructure left a lot to be desired.

I thought I would use the transit around me more often, but I prefer the freedom and fresh air of my bike so I only ride transit a few times a month anymore. I love that it‚Äôs a good option for me when I need it. 

I will say, living in a smaller space does make it a lot harder to buy a bunch of junk, because there‚Äôs just not space for it. It makes it much easier to be more intentional about our purchasing habits, not only with sheer willpower, but also out of necessity. We went a little too small in our first apartment, but we moved into a larger unit in our building after we got established here and I feel like we‚Äôve struck a good balance. 

This may or may not be important to you: but finding vegetarian and vegan options here that don‚Äôt suck is significantly easier than it was in my hometown. I often struggle to eat a well-balanced diet when I‚Äôm in rural areas because there‚Äôs so few options. Here, I have several restaurants in my neighborhood that cater exclusively to plant-based folks, and there‚Äôs usually at least 2-3 options per category at any other restaurant that I can eat. 

I may be biased as a happy city-dweller, and I know I had the privilege to be able to move here without worrying too much about getting a job, and I know I also had the privilege of having so many housing options to choose from. But I love living my simple, sustainable life in my city. || Cities. ¬†You have to build good systems, but if you have large groups of people concentrated with public transportation, etc, you can live more efficiently, which allows for more land not in use and less fuel used in transport, etc. || City for sure. Population density means more wildland and green spaces. If everyone on the planet owned a single family home, we would need several planets to support that. People in cities have a significantly smaller carbon footprint and use fewer resources in their day to day lives (walking for most errands for example) || We can‚Äôt possibly sustain most of the population living rural. || Dense urban living is typically far more sustainable than living rural, especially when it comes to infrastructure and services to support the population.

I've lived both rural and inner suburbs. Rural was car dependent, inner suburbs was often walkable, or at least had plenty of transit. One suburb I lived in had a farmers market nearby, about a 20 min walk. Rural had a 20 min drive to the supermarket, and not very fresh veggies to choose from. 

The food at the farmers market was coming from a max of 100 km, the food in the rural supermarket was travelling a minimum of 500 km, and that's just from the distribution centre to the supermarket, that doesn't count the 100s of km to get to the distribution centre, nor the time it sits there before being distributed. The longer food sits, the more likely it is to go bad before it gets used. || Cities are almost always better for sustainable, low-impact living, unless your rural life involves very little driving and an off-the-grid homesteading kind of approach. Plots and houses tend to be smaller, services and goods more readily available and shared with more people, and non-car options way more prevalent.

That said, spending time in and near nature is really important, and that can be harder to come by in cities for sure. To the counterargument you share, yes rural living is often more connected to nature, but don't confuse that with ""inherently greener."" Those are not the same.

A lot of sustainable choices are also not necessarily connected to where you live. Buying local, minimizing driving and air travel, reducing overall consumption and reusing instead of always buying things new, cutting down on energy use or relying on renewable sources.....these can be pursued wherever you live (though I find them to be generally easier in urban spaces, personally). || Lets approach this four  ways:

1st) A 'footprint' analysis, as if each person's lifestyle had a separable independent impact in terms of resources used and pollution produced.  Then you would assess that for all people and plot living arrangements against footprint and see..... that economic status and country that you live in has a huge impact on the scattergram, so you then control for that, and all other factors until you have a regression coefficient just for population density or some such proxy.  Most of the analyses i've seen suggest cities can get the per-capita footprint lower.

2nd) A 'knock out' or substitution analysis.  What is the change in total urban, suburban and rural 'footprint' when a person switches from one to the other, because some contributions have high fixed footprints amortized over larger or smaller numbers of people, while the obligatory per-capita consumption/pollution components are fungible.  I've seen only two, one from RMI and one from UNGDF... both still put urban life as a smaller impact, but it makes a big difference if the change is from a non-farming rural living to an shanty town, vs converting a farmer/forester to an office worker and moving them into an older highly capitalized city.  

3rd)  ""categorical imperative""  what would happen if EVERYONE participated in #2.  Then we actually see the a different effect, namely, cities cannot exist without countryside, but countryside can exist without cities (though when it does, material standard of living falls dramatically and hence certain pollutants fall while habitat loss and biomass combustion skyrockets).  when everyone becomes rural, (moving onto 20,000 m2  of land and 80,000m2 of salt water) that is more sustainable than if everyone moves to cities.  The simulations for this were presented at a poster at some conference in the early 2000s... and i have no clue if that work was ever published elsehere let alone reviewed/replicated.  

4th - cloud coo-coo land.  What is the urban-rural divide that minimizes the total aggregate footprint for pollution, consumption and habitat.  I have not come across any paper that considers this as an independent variable for the range of outcomes far from the current trends (i.e. most models i've seen just assume either the current distribution continues its secular trend, or remains constant, or declines to some arbitrary 20th century value.  If the answer is anywhere far from the current data, I'm not aware of it. || [removed] || The number one determination of living an eco friendly lifestyle is income. 

No, not for every single person

But extremely strongly, across the board. Rich people just consume exponentially higher amounts of energy.  I am pretty minimalist but I live in a 1700 sq ft house. Heating and cooling this thing kinda cancels out a lot of the good things I do that are fun to focus on. I need to be realistic that if I were poorer I would live in a smaller house or an apartment which would be much more eco friendly. || This isn‚Äôt a case of what someone‚Äôs ‚Äútake‚Äù is, if you want to know go look it up. You‚Äôve got to demonstrate at least a sense that you‚Äôve actually tried to educate yourself here before making such a low effort post‚Ä¶ || You should join r/abundancedems! || I‚Äôve lived in both worlds. Apart from the needing to drive to work 20 minutes vs 6 minutes everything else about country living is a more sustainable lifestyle. I have my own water source, I grow my own food, I have the capability to produce my own electricity. 

Being further away from shopping means I get creative with stuff often fixing something rather than just replacing something. My consumerism has dropped significantly. Almost all  my food is sourced from less than 5 miles from my home.

Plus I‚Äôm living the lifestyle, I live near the forests, lakes, rivers etc. 

There is literally a horse coral at my local grocery store. || I mean like everything else it depends. I suspect that generally cities are more sustainable, but sustainable communes certainly do exist and probably have a smaller footprint than even city living || Surprisingly, the idea that city living is more sustainable is actually a myth. The peer reviewed literature on urban living, energy consumption, etc. does not actually support it ‚Äî even in the densest, most walk-able and bike-friendly cities.

misfits vs bulk foods,"I‚Äôm 18 years old and I live with my family. I am vegan solely for the animals, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said that environmental concerns don‚Äôt play a role in my dietary habits. I‚Äôm an avid environmentalist, I want to lessen my impact. 

My mom has been letting me get stuff off of misfits markets because I tout the ‚Äúrejected‚Äù produce/unsold stuff to her, on top of occasional discounts for more sustainable products that are cheaper. 

Recently I‚Äôve been thinking of all the ice packets, cardboard boxes, potential plane flights/travel, and products that definitely weren‚Äôt rejected from grocery markets (bread, produce, tofu, tempeh) because only SOME the stuff on there is marked ‚Äúpackaging mistake‚Äù or ‚Äúslightly large/small‚Äù, or ‚Äúrescued‚Äù

I try to go to my local farmers market as much as possible for all produce, shop small as much as possible, and for goods such as grains, cereals, nuts, beans, legumes, and granola, I go to Sprouts. But for the stuff that I can‚Äôt get locally, say, bananas, pineapple, oranges, and packaged items such as tofu, tempeh, impossible meat, and whole wheat bread/other more processed options‚Ä¶ should I stop using misfits and just go to the regular grocery stores, picking out the misfit fruit myself (individual bananas, bruised apples, etc.) and buy the tofu, tempeh, and packaged goods there instead??

TLDR: Do I stop using misfits market and just go to Sprouts? I feel like they both have negative impacts (Sprouts only showing the best fruit they have at higher prices, and misfits having a more visible footprint)","I think you are overburdening yourself with these very minor details. Being vegan alone does so much for the environment compared to the same person that does what you do but is not vegan. As an 18 year old, I would be looking in skills to develop or a career to go into to help the environment. Changing policy, developing better energy sources, taking actions similar to Stop Oil, etc. can all have a much bigger impact than where you get your groceries. || Good on you for making thoughtful choices. 

Last year Sprouts changed their whole business model by jacking up rates and became less sustainable because they now compete with expensive Whole Foods. It‚Äôs summer, you can offset your Misfits shipment footprint by growing your own herbs and lettuce outside in a few pots.

I'm a complete ignoramus about this topic: Please educate me and give me some pointers,"Hello wonderful folks: I'm coming down to earth after years of denial in a radical section of the Church, that is intent upon looking away from climate change and the catastrophic effects of human choices upon plant and animal life. Climate change, they say, is a left wing hoax. I used to believe it for a long time and scoff at people who suggested something was seriously off with the planet.

They say the first step towards change is admitting there is a problem. While I understand that our current use of natural resources is unsustainable in the long run, and accept that climate change is real, I hardly know what I can do to make a change.

I hardly buy clothes, and when I do, I keep them for life. I buy them from military hardware store (Silvermans) so as to have extreme durability and lifespan. I have started to recycle. As you can see from my user name, I am a incense enthusiast. I've learnt a lot about the exploitation of trees for incense and only buy sustainable resins and from sources that ethically source plant resins. But what else can I do? The amount of information online is overwhelming.

Could you please give me a good starting point about learning about sustainability. I'm an intensely pragmatic person who believes in *doing* rather than *talking.* I live modestly, and I say this not as a matter of virtue signalling; just as a matter of fact. I don't drive. I eat vegetarian food. Milk is still hard to quit. Use public transport exclusively. But that's about it.

But I'd love to *do* more. If you know resources that I can use to convince some of my other friends, please point these out to. There is deep denial in some quarters. And I believe the answer is in providing so much information that denial becomes impossible. This is how I began to see the problem.

It's been a humbling and somewhat terrifying journey as I am starting to reckon the impact of my choices. I still don't want it to be true. It causes me serious anxiety as I deeply love the natural world and the thought of it all fading away is giving me sleepless nights. Is it really as bad as I think it is, and is the situation beyond hope? Please provide scientific, meaningful, practical responses. I'd rather hear the bad news than live in the land of lotus eaters.","From your post, you're already doing so much good stuff!! 


Unfortunately the impact that one person has is miniscule compared to corporations. So if you have the bandwidth for it, supporting environmentally sustainable policies and politicians is important.


But thank you again for being intentional and building sustainable habits! Actively pushing against the single use mentality is wonderful! || You can't tackle everything at once, so pick a few things at a time. A few suggestions for things you can do right now are:

Get rid of plastic in the kitchen. Cutting boards add microplastics to your food, plastic bags break down quickly, containers leech plastic into your food in the microwave. Glass jars are cheap or free storage. Hit the thrift store first. 

Pay attention to what goes down your drain. Aim to capture and use as much water as you can before it goes down the drain. Read the label of cleaning supplies and ask yourself if you really think the chemicals should be in the water.

Recognize where responsibility lies for the problems that were facing. Recycling sounds good, but it was actually intended to keep us happy using more plastic. The plastic industry knew full well that recycling was unworkable, which is a good reason why only about 9% of what we toss in the bin ends up actually recycled. || Welcome to  the good side.   There are many advances being made in shifting to alternate energy sources, more sustainable choices in food, etc.  It's such a big subject you can look into Universities and legit NGOS for information.  One really excellent book I read that delves into how the corporate world has gaslighted us  is   The Playbook.  How to deny science, sell lies, and make a killing in the corporate world.  By Jennifer Jacquet  Very eye opening and easy to read and discuss. || First off, congratulations for being able to change your mind based on evidence. Indoctrination is strong, and it is very hard to admit you've been wrong for so long. Seeing the truth after being taught for years to scoff at it is so much harder than just starting there. 

Second, you're already doing some of the biggest things you can do: eating vegetarian, and using public transit instead of cars.

Third, one of the biggest things you can do is *vote*. Fundamentally, the biggest problems are at the corporate and national/global levels. We should all do our part in our own individual ways, but we will not solve the problem this way. If we want to solve the problem, we need governments to work with us. That means voting for politicians who prioritize this issue. 

Fourth, tell others what you've learned. Because you come from a community indoctrinated to believe climate change is a hoax, you have many, many connections who need to know this; you likely have credibility in those communities; and you understand their perspective and the process for change. That can magnify your vote and your impact, if you can influence those around you. || One of the biggest positive changes you can make for the planet is stop eating beef. As a planet we are destroying millions of acres of rainforest in order to create areas to raise beef. Then the excessive amount of beef creates methane which is 5x more harmful than CO2. || Cool! Good on your for seeking reality, regardless of the social-costs. 

In terms of literature, I found the Bill Gates; How to Avoid Climate Disaster to be a great introduction to the problem and how society is poised to either solve it or perish. As posited in the book, I am a big proponent of businesses changing, vs. personal consumption changing. I feel as though this sub, and many sustainability movements focus on the personal choices we can make (ie; consumption) vs collaborative and business related efforts. Even if you don't work in oil-n-gas, you can make significantly more impact if you get a business or corporation to alter their strategy in a way that is beneficial for the planet. 

What's beneficial for the planet? If you really want to go deep, come over the Lifecycleassessment sub; where we discuss life cycle analysis; the only quantified method of environmental impact measurment that is universally agreed upon. One has to measure before they can effectively reduce...

The summary of how to make an impact though personally, is consuming less, of everything.

Opinion: Is it ALWAYS more sustainable to shop second hand?,"When comparing a brand new, expensive, eco friendly pair of pants made from natural fibers with a similar pair, second hand, made from plastic, which is more sustainable? ","Reusing an existing item is always more sustainable. || Sustainability isn't always about how its made. Being sustainable also means to be able to use what you already have. If there are pants that already exist, they're more sustainable than PRODUCING new (but eco friendly) pants. || I mean, some things might be actively toxic, I guess? Do don't bother with those, second hand or not. But barring that, second hand is almost 0 impact and 0 resource cost. Could even be negative impact, if it's keeping it out of the landfill. New will always have some impact and cost. || Refusing and reducing are the most sustainable for the environment. So, even if the second hand clothes had a worse manufacture, it is way better not to create another piece of clothing.

Living More Sustainably in Chicago,"Hi! I live dead set in the middle of Chicago in a studio apartment. I eventually want to move to a piece of land with a small house and grow crops, live more off the land, etc. However, I can't just up and move right now. So I come to you to ask this. How can I start living more sustainably in a city, and a studio apartment? What tips do you guys have? Looking forward to discussing. ","Living in a studio apartment in an urban area is already more sustainable than your future single family detached home is ever likely to be. So you‚Äôre already on the right track, particularly if your commute doesn‚Äôt involve a private vehicle.  
  
Some things you can do in an urban space to live more sustainably are:  
‚Ä¢Set up a clothes rack/line to air dry your clothes.  
‚Ä¢Shop secondhand.  
‚Ä¢Repair as much as possible.  
‚Ä¢Reduce/eliminate meat and dairy from your diet as feasible.  
‚Ä¢Reduce/eliminate your private vehicle use as much as possible.  
‚Ä¢Shade your patio/balcony/windows if possible, preferably with native plant life. Plants mitigate heat better than artificial shade structures.  
‚Ä¢Look into green energy programs through your local utility providers. Many offer renewable energy riders or the option to source certain amounts of your energy through renewable sources.  
‚Ä¢Replace any incandescent lighting in your apartment with LEDs.  
‚Ä¢Check (possibly [here](https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/professional-home-energy-assessments)) to see if Chicago offers home energy audits for apartments.  
‚Ä¢Join a local environmental action group to get involved in implementing sustainability focused change at the local level. || There are a lot of farmers markets in Chicago. I think buying from small and local producers/vendors is a great way to be sustainable while supporting small business and building community. There are a few refill shops in Chicago that you can look into, and if you're close to one that might be somewhere you can shop at. Also consider that sustainability is not just about environmental sustainability but personal sustainability as well. Make sure you're not taking on too much or stretching yourself too thin, time/energy/money-wise. Even if it's environmentally sustainable, if you can't personally sustain it it'll end up draining you.


Oh and see if you can grow some plants indoors, either with natural or artificial lighting if you have to! There are community gardens you may be able to get a plot at too, though those sometimes have rental fees and usually have waiting lists. || It's just my wife and I, so when our dryer broke down a decade ago, we decided to go without. It's been pretty easy, but it's just the two of us. We have a decent set up for hang drying cloths. 

We've bought reusable replacements for glad wrap and Glad Bags. The covers get washed with the dish towels. The bags are either hand washed or go in the dishwasher. We wash our actual plastic bags and get at least 10 uses instead of one. 

We found a few of these by watching Innovation Nation with Mo Rocca. I think it's a kid show but we are both over 50. ha ha. 

My wife found washable tissues. She's got allergies. We used to by Kleenex boxes by the 10 pack... No more. || Change to a vegan diet and commute to places by bike or public transport, you will decrease most of your daily CO2 emissions. || Thrift clothes

How to start becoming more sustainable on a budget?,"Title says it all. Me and my mom are a low-income household, I have a part-time job and she relies on utility/government assistance and is waiting on getting approved for disability. We both want to become healthier people and I‚Äôve been wanting to do things to be more sustainable in my daily life. Any tips? ","Limit food waste: better for your wallet and it‚Äôs the single most efficient thing you can do (because all the emissions, transport, packaging etc of half our food in the US is thrown away). If you can, you should start composting, it costs nothing and gives your good soil to grow food. You can also get a few cherry tomato plants and basil for this summer and you‚Äôll save many dollars in vegetables! Another inexpensive thing is to use swedish dishclothes and washable hankies. Tissues and paper towel cost a stupid amount of money! And then walk, bike or spend time outdoors (if you walk you can pick up trash to make it useful too). || 1. Tofu/beans have 2% the climate impact of beef and they're about 1/3 the price.

2. Drive less, if you can.

Organic products and ""natural"" products are only slightly better for the climate, if at all, and cost more. Don't waste your money. || Think about what you buy. I buy mostly bulk goods to avoid extra plastic and packaging. Bonus: it‚Äôs generally cheaper. When I bring something new into my house, something has to go. || I really relate to what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôve been in a similar place‚Äîtrying to live more sustainably without spending extra money isn‚Äôt always easy, especially when everything ‚Äúeco‚Äù seems overpriced or out of reach.

But honestly, a lot of the most impactful changes are the simple, free ones. Things like reusing what you already have, cutting down on single-use stuff, or just being more mindful about what you really need. For me, even small things like skipping plastic bags or walking instead of driving when I can started to add up‚Äîand made me feel better, too.

If you‚Äôre into tracking your progress in a way that actually feels rewarding, I‚Äôd really recommend checking out earthmera app. It‚Äôs a free tool where you can log your eco-friendly actions‚Äîlike using public transit or eating plant-based for a day‚Äîand it shows you how much carbon you‚Äôve saved. I didn‚Äôt think I was doing much at first, but seeing the numbers gave me this surprising sense of momentum. It kind of turned sustainability into something motivating instead of overwhelming.

You‚Äôre already doing something meaningful just by asking this question. That‚Äôs the first step most people never take. Keep going || Thrift stores for give and take.  Don't buy new.
Don't waste food.  Keep track of what's in the fridge.
Try more beans and tofu.  Spice is as you like.   It takes a little getting used to but its worth it.
Don't buy organic
Don't drive if you can
Being sustainable is usually cheaper || Definitely use up what you have first. Making the switch can be gradual. 

I really like [Oak and Willow](https://www.oakandwillow.store). I use their solid dish soap, shampoo and conditioner bars (theirs are the only ones I‚Äôve found that don‚Äôt make my hair feel oily), I use their loofa sponges for dishes, their laundry powder and toilet fizzies. The only thing I‚Äôve gotten from them that I didn‚Äôt care for were the coconut fiber scrubbers, they shed like crazy and make a mess. 

Dr Bronners castile soap is great and can be used to make quite a few things. You can even use it for body wash. I use it for mopping and foaming hand soap, I‚Äôm still working through a few cleaners I still have. 

If you go through a lot of paper towels, maybe try to switch to Swedish dishcloths or using old t-shirts and turning them into cloth napkins. Reducing and reusing are the key factors. You shouldn‚Äôt have to buy a bunch of stuff to be low waste. || All good advice below. On food, the less meat you eat, the cheaper it is to eat. In my opinion Mexican and Indian cuisine has the tastiest food you can make for cents a meal. The more you make yourself, the less expensive it is. Baking bread is going to get you much better bread for cheap, making soup is going to get you much higher quality soup for less than canned/frozen/restaurant etc.

Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) offer ""shares"" of local produce. It often (but not always) ends up being cheaper than the grocery store. The downside is less choice in the produce you get, so you have to learn to cook on the fly. I once ended up with 6lbs of endive and had to figure out what to do with it.

DIY also saves money everywhere else. Reddit has good repair and sewing communities. I'd also recommend seeing if you have a local Repair Cafe [https://www.repaircafe.org/en/](https://www.repaircafe.org/en/) that could help you fix broken items, patch clothes etc. 

All cleaners can be made with simple ingredients. I haven't purchased a ""cleaning product"" in years. This is my recent favorite.

"Battery Breakthroughs Driving a Cleaner, Electric Future ‚Äì Thoughts?","Hey r/sustainability,  
I came across this article about a new battery tech breakthrough and it‚Äôs got me excited about the potential for a cleaner, transparent, and fully electric future. 

Advances like these could make EVs more efficient and sustainable, cutting down on emissions and resource use‚Äîpretty critical for where we‚Äôre headed!  

To stay on top of stuff like this, I‚Äôve been putting together a weekly newsletter, Techwheel Current, that gives a quick TL;DR of the latest EV and battery tech news. 

It‚Äôs all about making it easy to keep up with innovations that support a cleaner planet without wading through tons of articles.  

Here‚Äôs a sample of what I‚Äôm working on: 

https://techwheel.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TechwheelCurrent_202504200201.html.  

What do you all think about this battery news? Are these kinds of breakthroughs enough to make EVs truly sustainable, or do we need more systemic changes?

How do I start and upkeep a fruit and vegetable garden?,"I know I am going to sound naive and possibly even stupid. I don‚Äôt ever plan on owning a home. I just want land. I want to feed people. There‚Äôs bigger things than proprietorship and home owning that matter right now to me. I live in a place called Merced, CA. Almost 17 percent of adults and 13 percent of children experience food insufficiency. And no one is doing anything. I can‚Äôt fix it. I know. It‚Äôs bigger than me or anyone. I want to at least say I‚Äôve tried. Please. Give me your gardening tips in detail. Pest management, crop rotation techniques, island planting, floating planting‚Ä¶all of it. I want a plan. It will probably take decades, but it has to start somewhere and I plan on spending my whole life trying to ensure as many people don‚Äôt go hungry as possible. Maybe after properly learning, hold workshops in schools or rec centers to teach sustainable farming. I don‚Äôt know. I know sounds utopian. But I just at least want to make a drop of change. Those who have built successful vegetable and fruit farms, are members of selling produce to farmers markets, or those with a thumb as green as the earth itself and see abundance, please let me know how you‚Äôve done it. I know I won‚Äôt help many, but any person is one person less with a hungry stomach. I know the feeling of hunger and emptiness in your gut. It‚Äôs not a good feeling and I‚Äôm sure an even worse one when one has children. I just want to do something. I have a degree, I‚Äôm going to make good money. I know my financial life will have abundance. More than I need to see or more than I will ever need. I just want to do this thing right, have a plan, finances, etc. set. Anything helps. And of course extensive personal research still needs to be done on my part, but any helpful suggestions would be amazing. ","That‚Äôs fantastic that you want to grow food to help people, we are doing the same. There is a lot to learn about gardening, far too much for a Reddit post. My suggestion is to get in touch with your local agriculture extension program, which will be run out of a university, probably UC Davis. They can point you in the direction you need to go for your climate. Good luck! Gardening isn‚Äôt for everyone, start small. || I would type in YouTube how to grow (whatever food your trying) and get tips on how to do it from there. 

My mom saved and dried shells to put in garden for soil nutrients and keep slugs away 

I look and see what you can even grown in your climate for example where I live pineapples and coffee beans can‚Äôt be grown but tomatoes and rice can 

If you know anyone with cows might ask if you could take some of there old poop not fresh for your garden ||   
Spinach can grow like a weed. Zucchini can be prolific, even in a pot. Potatoes are easy to grow, but they're also cheap to buy, so you might be better off using the space to grow a more expensive vegetable. Strawberries can grow in hanging pots, or window boxes. 

>Pest management

I wish I had known sooner that dishwashing liquid and water, in a spray bottle, will take care of aphid. I would have enjoyed more of my broccoli last year. 

Be hands on, check the undersides of leaves every day for caterpillars. Cabbage moth caterpillars are very hungry, and will eat everything. Remove them, drown them, squish them, feed them to the local birdlife, whatever, just get them away from your plants. || Did a search and found this organization in your town. Volunteers help at local farms to help with whatever they need in exchange for the organization received extra harvest to benefit local people and community food pantries. Would be a way for you to learn more about food security/insecurity while making an impact right off the bat and at the same time learn from local farmers. https://mmcfb.org/gleaning-program/ || The wise will say you don‚Äôt grow crops, you grow dirt. The first thing you need to do is evaluate your dirt. Does it support life or is it just a dusty wasteland? Does it get enough rainfall to support crops or have easy access to irrigation. 

If the ground naturally won‚Äôt support crops then you need to look at alternative methods, raised beds with good dirt brought in. Or container planting. 

Now that you have good dirt, either natural or brought in, you need to learn what you can grow in your climate. 

https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/

So now we have good dirt, access to irrigation and a map showing us our hardiness zone so we can figure out what grows wear we live. 

Now you have to figure out what you will actually use and what your goals for the food are. If you want to grow food for long term storage you have to consider that. What stores well, how are you going to store it? For instance traditionally we grow a years worth of food to ‚Äúmake it through the winter‚Äù so things like potatoes, beans, onions, garlic, apples, berries etc etc etc. and we have to grow a lot all at once because the growing season is limited. But if you live somewhere where you can grow all year long your needs may be different. 

So now we have good dirt, good water, a list of plants we‚Äôre growing and an idea of what we‚Äôre going to do with them once they are grown‚Ä¶..now we have to protect them as they grow. So fences, netting, chemicals produced or organic, shade cloths etc. so that we get most of what we grow rather than the bugs, birds, and other animals. 

And that‚Äôs it, simple. It only takes a lifetime to perfect. 

I would recommend starting with some grow bags or containers and buying plants from a nursery. This will give you some success to get your feet wet before you get into starting from seed. Which is a different mastery with some significant up front costs. || [removed] || I love this! I‚Äôve been learning to grow in my backyard for the past 4 years. I‚Äôm still not very good at it because snails are always eating my young plants. 

If you really want to have good results and you are determined, buy a seed starting kit with a grow light set up. Epic Gardening has a great video about seed starting and sells quality long lasting products that will save you time. Or choose the more sustainable route and use recycled materials, like newspaper (but it falls apart quickly).

Even if you don‚Äôt have outdoor space yet, you could grow a lot of vegetable seedlings indoors and give them away to your community. || [removed] || If you don't know anything about gardening, possibly this isn't for you. Growing food requires a lot of work and sacrifice. If it was easy to solve food insecurity, it would be solved.

NEED ADVICE: sustainable alternatives to household cleaners,"hi everyone, i'm moving out of my parent's house soon and i want to live as sustainably as i can. i'm asking all of you to comment sustainable alternatives to pretty much every household cleaning product- wet wipes, floor cleaner, bathroom cleaner, laundry detergent- every single thing that i can make an effort to not buy big brand for. i'm asking for tips, recipes, or links to forums i can read. ","Dr Bronners. You can make foaming hand soap. Wood floor cleaner. General household cleaner. For glass and granite counter tops, I do alcohol and vinegar.  For wood furniture, I do half water/half vinegar, a drop of dish soap, a drop of olive oil. For toilets, I use baking soda. I use baking soda to scrub tubs too. || Wet wipes? Use a cloth, water can make it wet. 

Floor cleaner? Dishwashing liquid in a bucket of water. 

Bathroom cleaner? Elbow grease and a coconut scrubber. Or bicarb soda and a moist cloth.

Laundry detergent? Soap nuts. || You can even clean glass with dish soap and a sponge at the right (low) concentration and with a squeegee- no need to use anmonia based cleaner on your windows.

Dish soap doesn't have to be antibacterial, soap itself kills a lot of germs. 

You don't need wet wipes. I even think toilet bowl cleaner is used way too much- if you scrub your toilet regularly, all purpose cleaner can go a long way toward reducing the need for caustic bowl cleaner.

Find out if you have a water softener and make sure it is maintained and salt is added as needed or you will have a lot if scale you will have to remove with CLR.

Zep is necessary for me to clean greasy stove and grease splash on areas around the stove. I cook a lot. || Laundry Detergent

Genuine question regarding fast fashion,"Okay, so since practically every major fashion brand (like middle class, mall fashion store type of thing) is fast fashion, what makes buying fast fashion directly from the source (Chinese site like Ali Express, Shein, or Romwe) worse? I don't buy from those sites because I agree that they're bad, but if other retailers are selling the same shit - just marked up - I fail to understand the difference.

Sure, there are sustainable small brands for handmade clothing, but those are often too expensive and out of budget for people. Same goes for larger, mass-produced brands like LL Bean, North Face, and Patagonia (which I think (?) are sustainable). 

Anyway, what's the difference between mall fast fashion and Chinese fast fashion if it's all the same thing but at different prices? 

I know that sites like Shein and Romwe steal small artists' designs, but that's not what I'm asking about. I mean specifically the ethical difference between fast fashion from the mall or from the aforementioned places. 

I think the guarantee of sustainablity with brands is getting harder to verify especially since places like Walmart and Target are green washing everything despite still engaging in harmful practices. The most sustainable thing you can do (in my opinion), is support those small brands that make everything themselves, or thrift your clothes. Thing is, it gets boring and I know plenty of people (myself included) like keeping their wardrobe fairly up to date. And while I don't personally buy from Shein, I do occasionally buy something from the mall or places like Target and Walmart. I thrift a good chunk of my clothes. 

So where do we draw the line? What makes one worse than the other? How do we sustainably shop for clothes if we can't afford the high prices of genuinely sustainable brands or want new clothes instead of thrifted?","Resale is the best answer. You don‚Äôt need that many clothes if you are a careful shopper, which cuts down on your shopping (and your storage needs).

So as the title says I'm looking for a sustainable lip balm option, I've tried cardboard cases but they tend to break apart in my bag and I can't finish the lip balm before the packaging falls apart, I've looked into Wild because I think a metal case would be the best option for me, but living in Lithuania the price is absolutely WILD (no pun intended) for a lip balm, I was wondering if there are other cheaper options? I was thinking of buying the case there and then maybe finding refills which work with the case?

how do I counteract my use of AI?,"Hi all, I'm (22F) a uni student and my lecturer has told me to really use and delve into AI models like ChatGPT and Perplexity for my upcoming assignment. however, I really dislike using AI models because of the environmental resources that prompts and results use up- do you recommend any other ways I can be sustainable in my life while I undertake this AI project, sort of to balance out my using it?","Vegetarianism is generally the easiest and most effective sustainability choice.


If I recall correctly, it's the training of the model (rather than the querying) that uses so much energy. || Depending on the values of your school/teacher, you can make a paragraph arguing against AI at the end of your essay and why not compare it to the added value you got from using it.

If your teacher is not a dick and your arguments are good, you wouldn't have a worse grade. Also, don't put too much pressure on your personal responsibility. Most of the resources used by AI, are during the training phase anyway. So like many things regarding sustainability, it is a topic we should decide as a society, not through the spectrum of personal choices (so it's incompatible with the current values of our society but I digress).

Sorry if everything is not perfectly understandable, English is not my mother tongue. Good luck. || Personally, I run my company‚Äôs servers in data centres that use 100% renewable energy in a geography with high surplus of wind power. In practice that means we‚Äôre using power that otherwise would be throttled to protect the grid and lead to less profit for wind farm
operators who,  because of us, can invest more into new wind farms, further accelerating the growth of renewables. 
We also use excess heat, so there‚Äôs additional process heat available in a local business park that otherwise might be generated by burning fossil fuels. 

AI doesn‚Äôt have to be a resource waste. It‚Äôs a choice, not a given. 
Plus, there are also tones of applications in AI for climate research, improving energy efficiency and more that help transition us to a zero carbon future. || If you have some flexibility in which AI models you can use and how you can use them, here are a few pointers to help you reduce your footprint. 

* The larger the number of parameters, the higher the energy consumption. So you should try to use a smaller model if possible (the number of parameters can often be found online, but not always). The latest ChatGPT model is much bigger than the previous one, and it's probably one of the biggest AI models out there, so it's probably best to avoid it if you can.
* Image generation consumes a lot more energy than text generation, and video generation is orders of magnitude worse. So stick to text if possible.

If you're interested, you can search for Dr. Sasha Luccioni online, she does a lot of work on the environmental impact of AI.

bed sheets,"Hi folks. I cannot tell if this is appropriate for this group, but I'm glad I found even if no. I am in the market for new sheets, and it has been quite a while since I bought any. 

The question of what fabric is a sustainable choice and within my budget is pretty complicated! Looking at the treatment of the agricultural and manufacturing labor; at the environmental impacts of growing, processing, and shipping materials and finished goods... 

I know I can't afford American-grown and -made organic cotton sheets. So, setting that aside as the best option, but not sustainable for my personal ecosystem, bamboo, cotton, other rayons, other options? What is the most sustainable option for bed sheets.

Egyptian cotton is always a good option for long lasting sheets. || someone here will be able to correct me on this but i‚Äôm under the impression that what is sold as bamboo is a rayon (rayon is synthetic)‚Äî so they use a natural source to distill a synthetic fibre. On one hand, it‚Äôs quick and easy to generate bamboo (‚Äúrenewable‚Äù), but on the other hand it is used to create a fabric that won‚Äôt break down in the ecosystem.

What makes living sustainably hard?,"What do you find is the hardest thing about living sustainably?

For me it‚Äôs something along the lines of: I eat plant-based, but for my healthy fats consume avocado and nuts like almonds, which require a lot of water to grow and can have other environmental impacts (lives and health of bees, transportation etc) 

üßöI find that to enjoy living sustainably and making possible adjustments, you have to accept imperfection. ","It takes a community to do it successfully. It needs to be a team effort. || I think that everyone has their wall. No matter how much I appreciate the need to act sustainably, there are always things that could be better. It is, however, damn near impossible for me to be as good as I would lime to be. The society and system I inhabit simply isn‚Äôt geared up to support my efforts. The more aware I become of the challenges that need to be overcome the more insignificant my efforts appear to be. 

And I speak as someone who has worked with environmental groups since the last century and who, at the moment, has a business directly related to enabling a sustainable lifestyle. 

What I have done to overcome this ever looming despair is to narrow my horizons and focus on my immediate community. This is a thing I can influence and enable. And that is what I try to do. 

But on my terms. || Yes, the water guilt is real!!!!  Also, I cannot buy certain fruits without buying plastic. It kills me, and soon my CSA will start up and free me from this, but only for part of the year.

  
I should say, though, that I did winter sow native seeds in my fruit plastic containers. I also had a few plastic containers from sushi take out. I can happily report these containers have lots of native seedlings that I plan on giving away to encourage others to go native. I will then save these containers and do the same next year. But still. Why can't they just give us fruit in cardboard boxes? || There is no ethical consumption under capitalism || Somethings I find make being sustainable hard are 

Being chronically ill

Have sensory issues 

Wanting aesthetic items (vintage/ kidcore/ fancy looking is my style)

Price of items || Capitalism makes it impossible. || The hardest thing I find is just having to thinking about everything so much. ¬†Everything I buy, how‚Äôs it made? ¬†What are the environmental impacts of that? ¬†What are the alternatives? || Everything comes in plastic. It‚Äôs possible to avoid it to some degree but not always. || Corporate Interests. Could have built cities around trams and bikes. Could not have subsided oil and beef. Etc. || Currently it‚Äôs that I‚Äôm a student and don‚Äôt have access to a lot of things that would allow be to be more sustainable. Like I can‚Äôt compost, I don‚Äôt have much fridge or freezer space to store leftovers or stuff going off, not risking a bidet getting grimy with flatmates. I try my best but it‚Äôs hard. Mental health also making it hard cause it‚Äôs easier and more convenient to have ready meals in plastic packaging than home cook more frequently. Hopefully i get more stable in many senses I can work more towards sustainable living. || The global benefits of living sustainably are greatest when everyone is onboard, but doing so requires an incredible amount of legwork that is specific to smaller groups and individuals. It makes having a ‚Äúmodel of sustainability‚Äù that someone can just follow along with difficult if not impossible. What‚Äôs sustainable for someone living in an urban area in a temperate climate is totally different than what it would be for someone living in the woods in deep latitudes.

Of course, back in the day this wasn‚Äôt so much of an issue because we lived where we lived and had to make it work with the resources and conditions we were handed. Sustainability was a necessary part of survival. Humans have endeavored to bypass that with a blanket model for civilization which essentially goes against nature.

So I guess my short answer is: globalization.

Second short answer: overthinking the concept to the point of abandonment. || The fact that American capitalism has made unsustainability so incredibly cheap and convenient that choosing sustainable is often more difficult.

Some examples I‚Äôve found:
- non-plastic toiletries are significantly more expensive
- non-plastic produce (usually from a farmers market) is more expensive
- it takes effort to remember your reusable grocery bags vs the plastic ones are RIGHT THERE
- cars are more convenient than public transportation in terms of flexibility (hours of operation, proximity to final destination, schedule, etc.)
- many items are significantly more difficult to find plastic free or lower plastic options

Now, that‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs not worth it or that some of these are a huge deal, but I think that they become obstacles to people who are currently very happy with the inexpensive and convenient nature of their unsustainable lifestyle. || Entropy. || The hardest part is that the definition of ‚Äòsustainable‚Äô is unclear. Is it carbon? Is it water? Is it energy? Is it bio-diversity? || Capitalism and private property depriving people of a collective commons || I've been trying to use sustainable household and personal care products for a few years now and I've recently had to accept they're not effective enough for me to keep it up. I'm really hoping it'll get better soon though and I can switch back.

Some examples of what I mean:
I tried to make shampoo and conditioner bars work for me, but my hair is super fine and easily damaged. I ended up having to cut a lot of because they weren't doing what I needed.
I've been using Nellie's laundry soda for years now but I'm switching to All Free Clear (powder) because Nellie's isn't cutting it for baby clothes || Start by defining sustainable. || Basically the entire concept of cities is not sustainable.

Massive populations on tiny footprints are always going to need a hell of a lot of resources transported from elsewhere to sustain it.

The transportation alone is a giant efficiency loss.

But people like their city life too much to ever concede this. || Fossil fuel use. My home is heated with gas, my food is heated with gas. Some of my electricity is generated with renewable energy, but I believe it has a fossil fuel backup (not sure exactly how my electricity is generated and transmitted by my electric company). I don't have the funds to do much to change these things and going full electric will cost so much more money on a regular basis because of how gas is priced. 

I use a lot of plastics even as I've tried to reduce the amount of single use plastics I use. A number of the reusable bags we use are ripping/breaking down and have at least some plastic in their creation and I continue to get so many of them from conferences as freebies which are easier/cheaper to use than fully canvas ones I would have to purchase.

My replaceable electric toothbrush head only comes in plastic. I could use a wooden one, but they don't make electric ones and I really like how clean the electric toothbrush makes my teeth. the filter I use for my fridge only comes in plastic and in plastic packaging. Lots of other things just come in plastic. || Transportation of food is such a minimal contributor to climate change, it is not worth worrying about. Most food is transported by land or sea, which are very efficient. The only foods worth avoiding are transported by air, ie. foods that spoil within days.

"Paper, plastic, or reusable grocery bags?  Some surprising conclusions.","Most of us don't have a NY Times subscription, so here are five key takeaways from *The New York Times* article ‚ÄúWhat Shopping Bags Should I Use?‚Äù by Rachel Nuwer:

1. **Paper bags aren‚Äôt always better** ‚Äì Though biodegradable and more recyclable, paper bags require more energy to produce and must be reused multiple times to match the carbon footprint of a single plastic bag.
2. **Plastic bags have a smaller carbon footprint** ‚Äì Studies show that low-density polyethylene plastic bags often have the lowest environmental impact when considering total life cycle‚Äî*if* used only once. (I imagine the same is true of paper vs plastic egg cartons... at least i remember one egg seller saying as much.)
3. **Reusable bags are only better if actually reused (duh!)** ‚Äì Totes, especially cotton ones, must be reused ***well over 100 times*** to offset their production footprint.
4. **Overconsumption of totes defeats their purpose** ‚Äì Accumulating more reusable bags than needed increases environmental harm due to the materials and energy required to make them. I know I own a few too many. :-(
5. **Reuse is what matters most** ‚Äì No matter the material, using any bag as many times as possible is the key to reducing environmental impact. Focus on **DURABLE** reusable bags and not the cheap-ass ones.","Also, another reason for the law is to keep the single use bags from blowing down the street, out of the trees, the waterways, etc.  And yes, we have a number of bags but the cheap ones will not last 100 uses but at least we can dispose of them properly.

I've still got so many of my childhood toys because I feel like if I donate them they'll just end up rotting away and polluting the ground, and at least if it's in my house then I know it's not in landfill.

  
If that wasn't bad enough, I've got a bad habit of buying whatever I see in second-hand stores that I feel like won't sell otherwise, because I'm afraid that it will end up thrown away if I don't rescue it.  


I have ASD and am being tested for OCD. My house is full. I'm so stressed and I feel so guilty whenever I have to throw literally anything away. Help.","Oh man, that is so hard - I really struggle with this too. And guilt is such an awful place to get stuck.

I'd start by taking a deep breath. It's true, we can't avoid some things going to landfills. Some things can't be fixed, or used safely again, or are just... garbage. You are not causing this. We have landfills because that's what our whole society does with trash. You don't have to be ashamed. Living in a broken system doesn't mean that you're broken.

If it's obsessive thoughts (like happens to me sometimes, where I can't stop imagining the long lifecycle of everything I touch), It helps to acknowledge that it sucks and I'm right, that is what will happen to things I throw away.

And it helps to think of waste differently too. The things we keep, that are making our lives harder or more stressful (or more sometimes more expensive!), are already polluting. Those things are still breaking down (albeit at a slower rate), and they aren't bringing anyone joy, and in fact, make your environment more miserable.

Buying the second hand things that are going to be thrown away: this is hard, but the above absolutely applies. And, realistically we can't know what someone else may need! I bought a half full box of dog poo bags today, hahaha.

Sorry for the long rambling post! With you friend. || Do you live somewhere that you can put things outside with a free sign? Maybe seeing other people being excited to take new ownership of some of the things will help you part with some of it. || It‚Äôs super important to think about the end game- when you are gone, where will these items go? They will go to a landfill, your home is just a stop on the journey. You are only delaying the inevitable. The best way is to consume less, recycle what you can, donate to good causes, and when you actually need something- buy secondhand when you can. You cannot save it from the landfill by keeping it at home. Deal with it now the best that you can, consume less, avoid shopping unless you actually need something. 

It is good to do good, but not at the expense of your health. Your immediate environment counts as part of that- a huge part! Rectify your living space, avoid rescuing others‚Äô previous purchases, live minimally, and do good when you can- do not let perfect be the enemy of good. || I struggle with this too. And struggled HARD when my circumstances changed dramatically and i needed to ‚Äúget rid of everything‚Äù to move countries on short notice. 

My friend and i did a really good job of selling or giving away most of it, but some of it did have to go to landfill. There was no other option for me at that stage, i was out of time (plus this stuff was essentially just ‚Äòuseful trash‚Äô- things most people would have thrown out but i was saving for just in case/the perfect project), and my friend really found the right words to comfort me‚Äîsomething along the lines of reminding me that i had always been so considerate about waste and compared to the average person, I had done more than enough (above and beyond) over the years to make sure that things didn‚Äôt go to waste. Everything got at least a second life or more whenever possible. That i shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty about such a small amount of things (comparatively) having to go into landfill because my mental well-being is important too and i‚Äôm allowed to ‚Äòhave to make sacrifices‚Äô sometimes. 

On the other side of that ordeal i can say it was extremely freeing to have to reset to 0. I‚Äôve now gotten much better about the hoarding thing, only keeping things for 6 months before they get re-circulated, and limiting myself to a certain amount of things. Worked hard on my willpower to stop myself from those impulse ‚Äòrescues‚Äô (it‚Äôs easiest to just not expose yourself to them) and worked hard on understanding that i am not responsible for the poisoning of the world nor saving it from that. I do my best every day to make decisions that have the least impact on the environment, and that‚Äôs WAY more than most people even bother with. 

I hope you find some peace. || I think it'd really help to find some recycling options. Electronics recycling is pretty common, some big box stores even take electronics recycling. There are clothing recycling options as well if you aren't able to sell or give away clothing.

You absolutely must stop buying things you don't actually need wholly shit though. That's a whole other level. || Buy nothing groups have saved me from worrying about where my unwanted items go. Saves that person from buying that item and gets it out of your house. || A lot of really good advice already in the comment section here. I‚Äôll just add:

Having physical clutter can lead to mental clutter. This can make us less effective and drain our mental energy that we could otherwise use to help the Earth in other ways. If you spend time, especially a significant portion of your time like it sounds you might be, dwelling on you clutter, then the opportunity cost is larger than the cost of donating, recycling, or even throwing your things away. || First thing you need to do is stop buying. Period. Everything else is secondary. || I‚Äôm so sorry this is happening to you. I think the best bet is to donate and throw away as much as you can until you feel you have something manageable to work with. We need you to be proactive and not overwhelmed. If you have items in good condition and are in the U.S., someone near you might be interested in some items. I have a slight case of this too, so I totally understand, but we all deserve to have beautiful homes and safe homes!! || I understand your dillema.  But almost no items are sustainable if they're not used, clothing in particular will usually degrade over time sitting in a wardrobe.  Perhaps find a local permaculture group or other sustainability group with likeminded people that will gladly swap your unused clothing for produce or tools, or labor. || If you're being evaluated, I assume that means you're working with a mental health professional? If so, you're doing exactly what you need to in this situation. Hoarding is complicated and extremely hard to overcome alone, but therapy and possibly medication can be really helpful. I'm cheering for you, knowing you have a problem is a big first step that a lot of people completely BURIED in trash can't even get to.


As far as the ZW aspect - sometimes we have to accept that trash will be trash. I know it sounds horrible but when your health (including mental) is seriously impacted by it, sometimes you have to just accept that. I'm disabled and have had to let go of a lot of my ZW habits because of it; I don't let myself stress about adding something to the trash (at least, nowhere near the way I used to) anymore because I simply don't have the energy to spare. When the piles of stuff get to the point of making it hard to function mentally, that is the point where you have to take care of yourself by removing some of it.


I recommend checking out Midwest Magic Cleaning on youtube. He's a cleaner who does hoarder houses and talks a lot about mental health and how it affects our homes, especially the mechanisms behind hoarding, because most people don't ""get"" what's going on with hoarders. He's not a mental health professional, but I find his videos helpful for motivation and he has some good tips.


Moving forward, the best thing you can do is to try to buy less (and accept fewer gifts if that's an issue you have - I have had the habit of not being able to get rid of gifts, even ones I hate), and to forgive yourself when you DO get rid of things. You're taking care of yourself, and that is really, really important! || It‚Äôs really helpful to get involved in community. Find your group out there, and you will start to see where you can flow things purposefully. 

For example, perhaps you are in a hobby group. Maybe some of the parents need toys for their kiddos, and as you get to know who is interested in what, you can try to rehome some things that way. Similarly you could ask around organizations to see if there is need for what you‚Äôre willing to part with.

Buy nothing and similar groups are great as well, since generally people are willing to deal with imperfections in buy nothing. Caveat: offer more than you receive in buy nothing!

If you pick up hobbies you might find ways to channel your stuff as well, such as maybe you could use your excess of clothes to start learning how to sew.

The important part is to try but not get caught in a perfectionism trap. I know it‚Äôs hard. Caring and making the attempt are fantastic things, but you need to leave enough space in your home to be happy, healthy, and pursue your interests. You can be careful about what comes in. For me, I like shopping secondhand, but I need to also make sure everything I acquire will actually have use in my house. Maybe no one else will find use for it after you leave it, it‚Äôs sad but it is bigger than any individual one of us. || Other than thrift stores are there places to donate? Children‚Äôs services, daycares, schools, low income, rehabs, transitional living, senior living? || Respectfully, your house is becoming its own landfill.

How can I live a more ethical and more sustainable life?,"I‚Äôm 90% vegan, I recycle, but I would like to be more aware and helpful for people and the planet. Any tips, even the smallest ones, to improve and be better in my life? Ecologically and socially ","Probably the best thing you can do is pay attention to your municipal politics and actively support policy change that could improve your community's environmental impact.

A new bike lane or a community garden will have a bigger impact than anything you can do personally as it sounds like you've already got all your own kit hanging fruit anyways.

Do as I say not as I do, however. It's not easy to do that kind of work. || Things I focus on:

\- I buy something new as a last resort.  I cancelled amazon. I avoid buying new clothes. I started repairing headphones, pants, etc. when they broke. When I do really need to buy something and be a consumer, I find Facebook marketplace is fantastic for scooping up quality things at a good discount.

\- I limit usage of heating/cooling. I live in the bay area, don't have AC, and really only have to deal with temps in the 40's during winter and 80's during summer. We turn the heat down to 58F overnight, and only up to 61F during the day. I always have layers on in winter, including fingerless gloves, and drink lots of warm tea to keep warmer. A nice cuddly dog helps, too.

\- I bike or walk or use public transit for my normal routines. I typically drive just once or twice a week: once to do groceries and sometimes another 10min to hike.

\- I eat relatively plant based. I usually split a dozen eggs with my wife per month since I really enjoy cooking with them.

\- I try to avoid flying for vacations. I'd love to fly to Europe next year. I hate how high the emissions are from it, but I am really excited and want to make it at least a bit more 'efficient' in staying for \~3.5 weeks.

\- If you have to drive a lot or take long road trips, buying an EV is really impactful. At least in CA, it's easy to monitor what % renewables are on the grid minute-by-minute. I always check this before charging and aim to charge when renewables are > 75%. [https://www.caiso.com/todays-outlook/supply](https://www.caiso.com/todays-outlook/supply)

Can someone explain whether the gravity battery concept is more sustainable than other comparable battery storage options we have right now?,[https://interestingengineering.com/energy/gravity-batteries-for-renewable-energy](https://interestingengineering.com/energy/gravity-batteries-for-renewable-energy),"That type of gravity battery where you stack blocks or use a weighted elevator in a mine shaft etc. isn't going to have a Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) that competes with chemical batteries. Where ""gravity"" batteries work is pumped hydro, where renewables are used to pump water to an upper reservoir and that water is then released through a hydroelectric generator into a lower reservoir in a closed loop, re-using the same water. These hydro power systems don't interrupt natural systems in rivers (though they do require flooding land) and provide a low LCOE way to store renewable energy form overnight to seasonally. 

The Australian National University has used satellite date to identify enough sites globally to get to a 100% renewable grid.

If it was as good as claimed, then everyone would be already doing it. Stacking bricks isn't a revolutionary idea.

The main form of gravity storage used right now is pumped hydro. This works quite well, and in locations where it's feasible, is a great option.

For other locations, some chemical battery storage, accompanied by gas and CCS is the general preferred option. See the UK's new climate plan, recently updated from 2020 which has reduced the costs of reaching net zero by 75%. ||

Plastic bags,"Even though I do my best to avoid it, a lot of products come in flexible plastic packaging basically plastic covers. My local recycling facility does not accept this type of plastic covers. However, my local grocery store does. Is it worth recycling these plastic covers at the local grocery store.

","If a grocery store has set up a recycling kiosk for polyethylene they‚Äôre likely actually recycling it, yes.

Personally when I end up with plastic shopping bags I‚Äôll often use them in lieu of a plastic liner bag in small trash cans (like bathroom cans), but that is partially because there is no consumer facing polyethylene recycling in my area I‚Äôm aware of.

"I'll be moving out some time this year, what are some low cost eco-friendly appliances/house hold items that I should prioritize buying?","I'd like to consider myself an environmentalist, I've moved my mother into using reusable bags and compostable dish cloths, but I still feel like I use so much disposable plastic. And since I'll be stocking my apartment full of stuff, I want to find things that last long and can be composted or (reliably) recycled at the end of their life span. However, I am a student so I can't afford like too much, just wondering what I should focus on","If you drink coffee, a French press or a ceramic pour over + a stainless steel filter (though brown paper ones are at least compostable too) - neither of these are super expensive, and they're super cheap compared to buying coffee out or even most coffee makers (which are filled w plastic anyway)

Making your own yogurt is one of the simplest ways to lower your food related plastic waste. While there's still the plastic from the milk jug (assuming you're not splurging for milk in glass bottles you return, which is out of most people's budget unfortunately), but it's less plastic than a milk jug AND a yogurt tub a week.

If you have a balcony or yard in your appt, or access to a community garden, imo the best thing to grow is luffas!! Without a true farm you're not gonna grow all of even a large fraction of your food, but you can grow all your kitchen sponges! Luffa makes a great scrubber, lasts a month or so, then in the compost it goes! Also great body exfoliater

Some bulk sections are very pricey.. Others are not. Bringing old spice jars and refilling them, or old soap bottle and refilling it, a jar and getting rice, beans, nuts, etc... Will drastically cut down your single use packaging.. And depending on the store, your budget too! Most also sell things like unpackaged bars of soap, etc

Personally I always recommend getting a folding drying rack - air drying your clothes not only saves electricity, it makes them last a LOT longer, especially natural fibers.

I find tons of glass Tupperware and Mason jars at thrift stores, this makes up most of my leftovers storage / lunch packing. I also have a few beeswax wraps, which I love - cotton, beeswax, and a little oil... 100% compostable and keeps a head of lettuce fresh in the fridge like nothing else!!

Also, if this is your first time furnishing your own kitchen, I cannot recommend cast iron cookware enough. I grew up with only cast iron pans and stainless steel pots. Anyone who tells you 'you gotta keep one Teflon pan around for eggs!' is wrong. I make scrambled eggs every morning in a cast iron skillet, and over easy for my man. Neither ever stick.Cast iron lasts forever, can be recycled, ups your iron intake in your food, and makes you food taste great
Bonus, you can transfer a dish from the stove to the oven, and use your regular cookware on a campfire. Speaking of, money saving tip - if you can't find a skillet at the thrift store, check out the camping section of a big box store - they gave lodge brand cast iron pans for half the price they sell the same ones in the cooking isle || If you want to be as sustainable as possible, buy used/second hand things. Need a coffee maker or kettle? Go to the thrift store or check the buy nothing page on fb in your area. Need a few tools like a basic screw driver or wrench or whatever? Again, buy used. Giving household things another life helps keep them out of the landfill and it stretches your budget a whole lot further. || Investing in good kitchen things is a good start. 

Stainless steel cookware is expensive, but good-quality ones will last a lifetime... way better than poisoning your food with teflon-coated pots and pans, and then throwing them out in a few years. 

If your budget can fit it, a teak cutting board is the same deal. Yes, there's some impact to acquiring the wood, but the board will last indefinitely and won't slice plastic into your food.

Perhaps also containers like Pyrex for food storage... again, another front-end investment, but the glass is so tough they rarely break, and again, no plastic-to-food transfer.

For things like dishes and tableware, I found great used ones at a thrift shop. And for glasses, I just use jars... it seems crazy to me to throw out jars and then buy glasses.   
And the drinking-jars and mix-and-match dishes give a place a warm, casual feel. || We changed all our soaps from liquids to bars. It removes a lot of single use plastic. 
We have one bar for handwash, another for shampoo, one for bodywash, one for stainremover on clothes, one for the dishes, and one for washing floors/house. 
You can find bars of soap made for any task. And they come in a piece of cardboard or paper. || Learn to cook on metal pans.
You can argue which type but use the ones that last and not nonstick. || Buy used. There is very little that can't be found in thrift shops and you aren't generating new ""carbon debt"" like you would be if you buy a new product. Its also a lot cheaper. Negative comments you'll see online about the rising cost of thrift shopping mostly refer to designer items that you used to be able to get for nothing, but that thrift stores now recognize as valuable items. If you're getting flatware, a microwave, a chair etc. the price hasn't gone up any more than general inflation. Pick items that will last and that are recyclable, google reviews of appliances to be sure. Also test anything electronic in the store if possible or as soon as you get home if not. 

eBay and ShopGoodWill dot com are online thrift options as are Craigslist, facebook marketplace etc. || Beeswax wraps are good and look for other reusable food wrappings. I‚Äôve got ones that stretch over cans and bowls too. 

Hear me out on this one: convection toaster oven. It heats and cooks quickly and you don‚Äôt have to heat a whole oven. || How about large, widemouth glass jars for storing dry goods instead of plastic bags? Rice, pasta, noodles, sugar, flour, etc. || Circular economies and buy nothings - if it's not urgent, I go by the verdict that dozens of people own this thing and will very likely get rid of it from disuse. So I scroll Olio, Freecycle, check charity shops etc and there's very few things I ever need to buy new and most of its free.


The key is /Reduce/, Reuse, Recycle in that order.

Would recommend. And learn basics of sewing. If you can do that, ever old shirt becomes a reusable bag, or a dish cloth.

Bubble tea and their plastic film,"I really wish that the concept behind stabbing the film of a bubble tea with your straw wasn‚Äôt a thing‚Ä¶ it renders the cup largely un-recylable since it‚Äôs essentially fused to it (and obviously the film can‚Äôt be realistically recycled.)

Personally I feel like it‚Äôs more of an inconvenience to have this film because it‚Äôs harder to stir and sometimes you can‚Äôt really get every last bit of the drink without tearing the film off (which many don‚Äôt feel that obliged to do). So‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt all that user friendly, right? 

Additionally, if you have any syrup in your drink it‚Äôs usually more of a chore to stir since you have a small opening to manipulate the straw inside the cup. 

I get that the stabbing of the film and the look of the film (branding/design) add to the whole appeal/excitement around boba‚Ä¶but I feel like it‚Äôs so unnecessary at this point. With the increasingly troubling news around plastic and the difficulty in properly disposing of it it just seems odd that it isn‚Äôt the default to have a hard plastic lid or an option to forgo the film when ordering. 

What thoughts do others have around this? "," Before you stab the drink shake the cup so everything is mixed. Peel the film off after drinking and recycle the cup discarding the film. Our boba uses compostable cups. || I am skeptical about plastic recycling overall. I would bet the majority of our ""recycled"" plastic just ends up dumped in poorer countries who import it for what foreign exchange they can get. I suspect landfilling it close to where it is consumed is actually a more responsible solution, aside from actually not producing and consuming it at all. || I'm not advocating for plastic film in anyway here, but after talking to a guy who runs a materials reclamation facility (MRF), I put mine in my plastic bag recycling that I drop off at the grocery store. || What I hate even more than the plastic film is the Boba shops that use super thick cups and tops, that are practically reusable water bottle level material. Yes, you could take it home and use it, but I really doubt most people will. It's so incredibly wasteful. Thankfully the boba place in my neighborhood is more than happy to put my milk tea in a reusable cup! || yeah ive had the same thought, and since boba is very much just a ""nice to have"" luxury in terms of the economic definition, i just go without it. i've thought about getting a bottle that's suited for boba but it'd take ages to earn itself back environmentally and myeah.

very specific topic. same goes for crisp packets and such too. || On a personal level, it‚Äôs a pretty small drop in the bucket. You deserve a lil sweet treat every now and then, and the world has decided that plastic is cleaner and safer than other materials. Hopefully you‚Äôre making other sustainable choices and advocating for change on a bigger scale. It is impossible to cut plastic out of our lives right now. I‚Äôm not saying we shouldn‚Äôt try, but reasonable people can make different choices on what‚Äôs important to them. 

Some possible actions one could take if this is your cause:
* Prioritize patronizing shops that let you bring your own cup/straw
* At other shops, consistently ask if personal cups are allowed (to let them know that there‚Äôs desire for that in their customer base)
* Always rinse and recycle your own cup and your friends cups if you go together
* Write to the business owners to express this concern
* Invent a film made from plant-based materials || I agree but unfortunately a lot of Asian products are not sustainable at all. There‚Äôs an Asian bakery i used to go to and so many of the pastries were individually wrapped in plastic. The Asian grocery stores were the  same, some fruits and veggies in plastic packaging. It‚Äôs a bummer.

It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve had boba but is it possible to ask them to not put the film on it when you order? || I appreciate you bringing this up as I‚Äôve often thought about this very thing. There was a place in Little Tokyo (DTLA) that sold these narrow glass jars for boba tea and if you brought the jar back you‚Äôd get 10% off your drink the next time.  That place didn‚Äôt survive the pandemic but I loved the idea of reusable jars for boba milk tea. 

Also, protip for stirring: push the straw all the way down and gently bubbles into your tea. Mixes it up nicely and it‚Äôs satisfying in an after-school chocolate milk kinda way. ü´ß || It‚Äôs such a small thing to worry about.

On a much larger scale: Why are we buying sugar water with tapioca starch pearls which get transported around half the Earth in the first place? || I take my reusable boba cup when I plan to get a beverage while I'm out. Then I don't have to feel bad about the plastic film or single use cup and straw. || I've been nagging my favorite bubble tea brand about this both on their socials, and in store, to come out with reusable mugs with specific sizes like Starbucks used to do. They may ignore my lone, thin voice forever.

Advice on producing less bottle waste,"I am in college and in a dorm, and I often use protein shakes like Orgain or chobani to get protein since I struggle with reaching my desired protein intake because of the dining hall food. But I am concerned with how much waste I am producing with using the premade bottled protein shakes. While the orgain is cardboard, the chobani is plastic. But I can not really make meals because I am in a dorm. Does anyone have suggestions on limiting my plastic waste while still getting the same protein intake?","But protein powder in bulk and a Ninja blender. You'll save money and cut waste. || Does your dorm not have a shared kitchen? Buy powder, a water filter pitcher if it doesn‚Äôt already, a wide mouth mason jar, and either a mason jar lid, frother, or shaker ball. If people start to use your stuff, you can use a box to carry it all to kitchen, mix, drink. Add drinkable water as soon as you finish using to rinse off some bits. If the jar came with a cover, Drink and clean. It takes 5-10 minutes each time but you‚Äôll get the time back in ordering, opening, and lugging the bottles you order now.

[Discussion] Does selling my ICE car to buy a used EV actually make sense?,"Hey all, I've been debating selling my ICE vehicle in favor of an EV. I still need to save quite a bit to feel comfortable doing so. 

I can't help but think that selling my ICE is more a performative act than actually helpful. Lets say my car will go another X miles before it dies completely. If i sell it now, it will likely be driven those miles by the next owner. If i don't, then i will likely drive it those X miles. Either way, it will get driven, and those emissions created. Its just a matter of whose ""fault"" those emissions are.

The other thing i think of is that i plan to buy a USED EV. New ones just aint worth the price. But if i were to buy a new one, that contributes to overall sales figures and encourages the manufacturer to manufacture more. A used one, much less so. The manufacturer will not see the proceeds of used vehicle sale.

Lastly, i wonder if saving my money by driving my vehicle til it dies and allowing EV prices to go down, will maybe let me retire a bit earlier or work less hard, thus contributing a bit less to the economy, which is indirectly better for the environment. 

In the end, I think i'm preferring to save my money to afford things like a home eventually, rather than doing the performative swapping in of an EV for my current vehicle. I guess i could scrap my current ICE versus selling it, but damn, thats expensive. I could easily fetch $10k for my vehicle in working order.

Any other thoughts? I didn't even touch on the embodied carbon of making a new vehicle, but thats another thing too.","Here's a great video by an engineer titled ""Is Keeping Your Old Car Better For The Environment"" on YouTube, that answers your question: [https://youtu.be/L2IKCdnzl5k](https://youtu.be/L2IKCdnzl5k) || You used ICE car MAY be purchased by someone else. I would posit that the buyer is driving a worse/older car than yours. Down the line eventually a truly crappy sh\*tbox gets taken off the road and if we are lucky gets recycled.

From a strictly monetary standpoint I think it isn't easy to justify BEVs, of course situations differ. From a carbon standpoint I think it is easier to justify, but again depends on the situation. || I drive an EV and I‚Äôve spent $1,157 to charge my car this year as opposed to the (approximately) $1,251 I would‚Äôve spent on gas. 

I‚Äôm not pro- or anti- buy an EV. I just want to offer a range of experiences. I can‚Äôt charge at my apartment and there‚Äôs only one free charger near me with a 3 hour limit. I make long road trips every so often and supercharge, that adds up pretty quickly. 

It‚Äôs all about your lifestyle and what options are available to you || Where I live, you can deliberately scrap (and therefore recycle) your old car in favour of an EV, and because we're running everything on hydro, that's a win for air quality in the region every time. The government gives you an extra rebate for doing this. 

>Lastly, i wonder if saving my money by driving my vehicle til it dies and allowing EV prices to go down, will maybe let me retire a bit earlier or work less hard,

You won't. The payback from spending 1/10th as much money as you currently spend on gas, will absolutely be a win for your bank account. Especially if a used EV will totally fill your current driving needs. At worst, it will be a wash financially, but you wouldn't be coming to us asking this question if finances are your only question.

I currently have a 2019 Nissan Leaf with the 40kwh battery, and I \*rarely\* pay to charge. My work has a free to use charger that I can even use off hours, and I simply don't drive enough to need to charge beyond that. 

Coincidentally, the ""perfect"" solution that many people harp on, is to get rid of your car completely. You'll instantly save money on every car expense you have. Since you're almost certainly American and that sentence probably caused a panic attack, an EV is always the better choice in a car-dependent world that isn't going to change anytime in the next 5 years. You *could* find a way to go car free, and then do so, but that takes planning and chances are, moving to a place that makes it even possible to do so. You could say that I'm ""lucky"" that I live a 5 minute walk from both work, *and* the mall that meets nearly all of my consumerist needs, but I did that on purpose, and so can you. || This isn't as straightforward as you might think! As there's a break even. It's a relatively basic simultaneous equation, and while it's true to say the earlier you start, the better at an individual level, that's not the case as a cohort.

If the whole cohort starts at the same time, dumping emissions for every EV car into the ecosystem at once, would see a spike in the emissions concentration but just like being constipated, that can take time to clear [for every humongous push, only a tiny bit is removed for ages until your bowels return to normal]. If everything is functioning normally, your a** can excreted a days worth of normal digestion. But under [Carbon] constipation conditions, it degenerates so it doesn't unblock. Even with LESS demand. 

It's a lot like London's tube during the 2012 Olympics. The tube grinds to a halt every single day when 3 million people a day catch it to go to work at rush hour. They told londoners at the time to work from home or stagger their starting time. Which Londoners did. The tube not only was quiet as heck, so much calmer, it supported 4.5 million people on it every day during those two weeks! 50% more than normal. 

It's completely counterintuitive (which is why I argue everyone has to lead advanced maths or physics) but is entirely predictable through queuing theory. Which is precisely what I use when modelling the ppm in the atmosphere, since the ppm concentration is basically a queue of Carbon Dioxide that is waiting to be serviced by a nature based solution. 

So the one thing you don't want to cause is Carbon Constipation. || Generally the most sustainable choice is usually using what you already have. I think that‚Äôs true in this case too. 

Yes an EV would use electricity instead of gas, which is better for the environment. But, I think you have valid points as to why you should drive your car until it can‚Äôt be driven anymore. 

It may be more impactful to find a way to incorporate other lower impact transit into your life. Maybe bike or bus around town or take a train ride instead of a flight. Any time you can travel in a more sustainable way is a win even if you don‚Äôt sell your ICE. || It took me hot second to realize ICE stood for internal combustion engine. That‚Äôs a loaded acronym in this climate. || What model and how fuel efficient is your current vehicle?

It is a reasonable bet that economically it is wise to keep your current vehicle then buy an EV when its no longer worth keeping on the road.

As for new vs used EV, if you buy used then someone else buys new, if you buy new it helps solidify demand for more EVs vs ICE. And an EV had to be built to lead to a used one for you to buy. Frankly either one is fine for your next vehicle. || How much you drive is probably a bigger deal than what you drive. Can you put the same effort to lowering that? || Yes || In a couple years, most used ICE personal vehicles will be worth 0, at trade.  They'll sell so poorly, that recycling yards will be full of them, and the prices for scrap will drop as well.

Sure there'll be some exceptions with collectable cars and some trucks built for work.  

People don't understand that adaptation has not been slow and steady across the globe. The rate for adaptation, when put on charts  are what they call hockey stick curves, and in the US, (assuming you're US) are nearing the part where the blade meets the handle of the curve/hockey stick.  EVs are already 25-50+%. Of new car registrations in most US metropolitan areas, and it's not just limited to Blue States, Houston and Miami are among the cities at the top.

Added: and US policy won't keep them at bay.  BYD just announced yesterday that they've added driverless to all 13 models of cars they make, without raising prices, and in a couple models lowered them instead.  Without tariffs, their cheapest model is now priced just over 8k -brand new, with Tariffs it's $16,000 in the US.  We (the US) aren't just behind, we've already lost this battle.

(Added) I've been driving EVs for 9 years now, between 2 vehicles a Fiat 500e then traded for a Bolt - I bought them both used with warranties, since they were dealership leased vehicles .

I've spent about $700 in maintenance costs for all 9 years combined, almost all of which was a new set of tires.  Other than that, wiper blades, wiper fluid, and light bulbs.  I did have a clip break on a door handle that I could have probably gotten done with the warranty, but the $20.00 part and 20 minutes to fix wasn't worth the time to deal with the dealership (the only manufacturing fault I've encountered)  I spend no time at gas stations, and I plug in at home from a standard outdoor wall out using level 1. (Your driving habits dictate your need for charging levels, so this might not be possible for you).

They're much more enjoyable to drive.

Who Gives A Crap household paper goods with no plastic,"So I recently ordered Bamboo TP, Recycled Paper TP, tissues, kitchen trash bags and kitchen cloths from WCAP. I am replacing Costco/Kirkland toilet paper and paper towels and kitchen trash bags. Small step towards reducing plastic packaging that comes into my home. 

  
48 rolls of recycled TP is $52 for ""subscribe"" which works out to $1.08/roll for 385 sheets. Bamboo is $1.21/roll for 370 sheets. Kirkland is cheaper at $0.70/roll, so ultimately need to determine if this is a ""worthwhile"" change. 

Now - do folks consider that this is being shipped to my home, instead of me buying from a ""local"" store, even if that's Costco? I am managing multiple desires of wanting to support brick and mortar stores in my community and state, wanting to reduce emissions of the goods I purchase, and wanting to reduce my plastic consumption. 

This is just one small thing - but does any organization out there calculate carbon footprint of choosing mail order plastic free product like WCAP versus brick and mortar purchase at costco? I'd love to dive more into this to really see my ""net impact"" when I make these smaller adjustments.

Extra benefit from WCAP is they donate 50% of their profits to charities that bring clean water and bathrooms to areas that need it. ","I do find WGAC worth it (I get the recycled paper), but everyone‚Äôs situation is different‚Äî I don‚Äôt mind paying a but more per roll because as a single person who also has a bidet, I simply don‚Äôt use as much toilet paper as a family (especially one with kids), and as a disabled person, having it shipped to my house is a lifesaver. I like the fun papers for wrapping gifts or decorating. And I get to support a small business (one that, as you say, does a lot of good in the world) instead of EvilCorp. I would say that‚Äôs what really makes me feel good about my purchase. But everyone‚Äôs mileage may vary :) || I am no expert, but one thing is that Bamboo, while better, is still destroying the earth.

More choices means more waste.  It‚Äôs like socks‚Ä¶ the more types of socks you own, the harder it is to find a match.

I have no idea if this logic is backed by science and research, but I buy Kirkland TP for these reasons.  Shipping directly to your house does increase the footprint of the item.  I really want to get a bidet to ultimately cut down on my TP use though.  I think that is the most sustainable option. || I know this is the sustainability sub but I‚Äôll say a part of my decision to switch away from big brand TP and PT was the chemicals used in them and not wanting to be wiping that on my skin.

Children's Birthday Ideas,"Hello group, long time lurker, first time poster in this group. I hope this inquiry meets the guidelines. I wanted to have collaborative ideas and suggestions thrown at me (and for others that could benefit) on hosting sustainable parties? I have a 3 year old, and of course i'll be waging the next \~15 years with parties and want to do my best to keep them eco-friendly/less wasteful. 

I've done a few minor things such as ensuring I buy paper compostable plates, compostable cutlery (although I'm still annoyed that I have to use wood ones!), using juiceboxes/cans of soda that can be recycled, and looking at ""value adding"" goodies such as books or little stuffies, instead of a bag full of useless plastic toys. I did not go with standard latex balloons, I opted for those foiled helium ones because I can deflate them and reuse/give away. 

A few things that bothered me were the plastic table clothes - I'll be swapping that for a washable fabric one, birthday hats (is there such thing as reusable ones that are actually built to withstand a child?), ideas for goody/treat bags that are actually valued and not single-use items, and any alternative to balloons/other decorations. 

I know it might be easy for some to say ""skip all that stuff"" but I do think birthdays are a thing to be celebrated. if it means I spend a little more time and money on sustainable options, I'm happy to do it. I would love input on any neat or unique finds as it relates to parties/birthdays/kids celebrations. TIA","Why using disposables? Do you have any plastic cups and plates to use instead of paper plates? I've been using those IKEA cups and plates for over 20 years, we still use them occasionally in the kitchen today. You find them for cheap at Goodwill. And why not use proper cutlery? Can't be so hard washing some dishes and forks. 

Expect a lot of food waste. Offer only one kind of food, and only in small servings. Each kid needs to get exactly the same, down to the colour of the gummy worms, trust me LOL 

For loot bags and prices: crayons, bouncy balls, a small cute fabric bag to fill with a few goodies, craft material, colouring books, flashlights, finger paint... || I bought a bunch of flower garlands to decorate my kiddo's parties. I use some of them now on my patio to add some colour, wrapped around pillars and running through nonflowering bushes. I also reused the same colourful paper lanterns and dangly things every year. For 20 years I have been able to decorate for a party on a moment's notice without ever leaving my house to get new supplies. 

My loot bags were always a big hit. Everyone loves bubbles. You will be everyone's favourite parent if you give bubble guns. Bubble wands were another hit as were bubble necklaces and bubble rings...which I carried in my purse for years as you never know when a situation calls for bubbles.

Organic omnivore diet Vs Organic vegan diet,"Hello

As the title states organic omnivore diet vs organic vegan diet?

Tbh the answer seems clear cut, organic omnivore diets are you not sustainable unless it is like 99% vegan anyways. Organic animal agriculture is just not feasible, when I say organic in this sense I mean animals being allowed an organic life like grazing. We do not have land enough for the billions of land animals we eat.

Organic vegan diet seems highly beneficial for everyone, the animals and the planet.

Organic is the way forward full stop, we can not keep spraying our food with toxins.

And animals also need to be freed from factory farms, animals should be in nature not factories. 

The facts are clear on this, if we want a healthy and sustainable world.","For me, 'organic' isn't really the key / isn't enough, especially with animal products. 

Like, I have no problem with local eggs. If anything, they're usually a net positive for the environment - chickens eat food scraps and turn them into great soil faster than traditional composting. Having had chickens, and worked at a local permaculture Ed center that fed their chickens 100% from leftovers at a local food pantry, then donated the eggs back, I really cannot see small scale laying as harmful

But I don't extend that view to factury farms. Even pasture raised - yes the animals get a slightly better life, and that's a win... But they're still fed pretty much entirely from pellet feed, which means much higher land use.

The kicker of course is that truly free range local eggs CANNOT be labeled organic, because there's no way to know, officially, exactly what the chickens ate. Wild foraged ticks are not usda organic certified. Etc etc

Similar with meat - the most sustainable options aren't organic factory farmed, they're backyard roosters and hunted game.

For fresh veg, I focus on what's in season locally. In winter that means mostly greens, carrots, and my own storage crops and canned goods. Dry bulk goods (rice, lentils and beans, etc) yes typically I just buy organic in bulk from reputable brands. But for veggies, for the most part if I can't get it at the local farmstand I try forgo it. I am not sure I even trust the organic label in the grocery store, and anyway it's all grown hydroponically in plastic.

Overall I don't see vegan as realistic for me, between protein needs working all day outdoors and not wanting to buy monocropped soy and in general minimize buying things from far away. But I do try to eat meat infrequently, and never beef. 

Trying to give up dairy but my fiance is not into the idea so we're planning on getting goats as soon as is realistic, we have forest they can happily browse to their hearts content in so hay needs shouldn't be too high. And at least this way I'd know no milk comes to humans before babies are old enough to wean at a natural healthy age, unlike dairy from the grocery store where baby never gets to nurse",6,sustainability,2025-02-08 14:49:15,organic omnivore diet vs organic vegan diet,hello title states organic omnivore diet vs organic vegan diet tbh answer seems clear cut organic omnivore diets sustainable unless like vegan anyways organic animal agriculture feasible say organic sense mean animals allowed organic life like grazing land enough billions land animals eat organic vegan diet seems highly beneficial everyone animals planet organic way forward full stop keep spraying food toxins animals also need freed factory farms animals nature factories facts clear want healthy sustainable world,organic really key enough especially animal products like problem local eggs anything usually net positive environment chickens eat food scraps turn great soil faster traditional composting chickens worked local permaculture ed center fed chickens leftovers local food pantry donated eggs back really cannot see small scale laying harmful extend view factury farms even pasture raised yes animals get slightly better life win still fed pretty much entirely pellet feed means much higher land use kicker course truly free range local eggs cannot labeled organic way know officially exactly chickens ate wild foraged ticks usda organic certified etc etc similar meat sustainable options organic factory farmed backyard roosters hunted game fresh veg focus season locally winter means mostly greens carrots storage crops canned goods dry bulk goods rice lentils beans etc yes typically buy organic bulk reputable brands veggies part get local farmstand try forgo sure even trust organic label grocery store anyway grown hydroponically plastic overall see vegan realistic protein needs working day outdoors wanting buy monocropped soy general minimize buying things far away try eat meat infrequently never beef trying give dairy fiance idea planning getting goats soon realistic forest happily browse hearts content hay needs high least way know milk comes humans babies old enough wean natural healthy age unlike dairy grocery store baby never gets nurse
Nothing single-use is sustainable in my opinion,"I work in the events industry and the amount of effort people put into trying to find the most sustainable disposable item is mind numbing. The people profiting off this stuff did such a good job brainwashing people it's wild. Compostables for instance: The effort it takes to source something locally compostable, communicate to people where it goes, properly sort it, separately pick it up, just so it can break down and we can do it all over again?! There's usually a reusable solution, and we need to start messaging around the fact that ""disposable"" plastic/paper/aluminum is in one category, and reusables are in a different one. What do you all think?","So I'm going to be slightly awkward, and say that in order for something to be sustainables through a single use option, the single-use option must consumer resource that is renewable in a shorter time frame than the single use item will live.

A single use pen has a different lifetime to a single use business card which has a different lifetime to a single use marketing puzzle thing.

Now cover with the events industry in particular come on the lifetime of the thing is so short, that it's completely impossible for anything in nature to conceive come up be harvested and be replenished in the lifetime of the single use thing. Even close bags are incredibly unsustainable because they consume anywhere up to 20,000 times the amount of resources of a plastic bag and the plastic bag is no single use ( in the sense it doesn't break down and you cannot generate another one from scratch because you have to generate the oil which will take 80 million years)

So being as Bruce Lee honest and you could possibly be come up the events industry as a whole is impossible to make sustainable full stop in essence it shouldn't exist.

I want two businesses one of them is a Carbon net negative organisation. One factor in maintaining that is that we do not purchase booths or sponsor events because events are innately unsustainable. We just don't do them. Even my first business come up which did do at one point never got as much out of them as you would pay for the Booth. You have to put so much money into the process that you at best, break even. So my second business just doesn't do them. Since you don't get as much back as you put in, unless you are already a huge brand and to get there you have to be unsustainable. It is completely the worst possible way of trying to raise the profile of your business.

Most events organisers don't really care whether you make money from hosting a booth or not. The vast majority are not commercial people from the perspective of the stall holder even if they are from the perspective of the event called because you have to get enough of empties to make it worthwhile and you have to get enough people buy the Booth to cover your costs.

The only way you can make an event sustainable with single use items come off in some form is if you end up taking single use items that are then recycled it comma and upcycled into something else there is more useful not less. I want to click we are the only people that do this and it requires a shift in effect organizes thinking to make that happen ND generally, the events industry is quite stubborn and has a lot of inertia in its desire to change. So generally it doesn't do it. The formula is the formula that's that.

For example, instead of hosting a booth, our entire business could put an entire circular microeconomy inside the event itself. Capturing waste throughout the event, whether that is reusable containers to be cleaned or single use, and then turning it into products for the current event or the next one at the event itself. That means we could take single use festival drinks cups at the event knowing what the next event would be and we would turn those festival cups into merch for the next event or whatever else, from that waste in real time. It also speeds the clean up activity because this is happening as the festival goes along and is not just building up in bins to be taken out later. Which is especially bad at festivals because the amount of waste there is astronomical! Even though it's got better over the last couple of years, the account of perfectly good tense and other stuff that people are just dumping is unreal!

So yeah, that's where I/we sit. || 100% 

The nfp I work for has collaborated with a local
Seaside market to fund and voluntarily staff a wash station for reuseable cutlery and dishes.  

So much more effective than our volunteers standing around bins sorting recycling. Saves the vendors money too but so hard to get them to see that this is viable.

Edit: most 'compostable' packaging is not actually compostable it degrades but it doesn't add anything nutrient wise.  Bioplastics and paper fibre sprayed with hydrophobic agents release PFAs. || Environmental sustainability is not profitable, reusable food safe containers require washing = cost

Disposable = cheap

The path to success requires everyone to spend more on sustainable options so unsustainable practices end.

Chances = low || Yeah this is why I don't pick up anything at trade shows anymore. It's all junk and I'd rather not contribute. || I would make an exception for medical/infectious purposes.

Creative, resourceful, but it got me thinking - Is it safe to grow food in plastic bottles, given the potential health concerns? 

Could microplastics and chemicals leach into the produce and eventually make their way into our bodies?

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. Have you tried growing food in reused containers? Is this a sustainable innovation or a potential health risk?","So... Almost all veggies bought at a supermarjet are grown in plastic, usually hydroponicly like a fancier version of this. Microplastics are already in everything, including our blood.

Obviously buying used is always the best options for sustainability. Creating a new product will almost never be better than using something that's already made.

This is why when I need new cookware (as rare as that may be) I head out to goodwill or antique shops, and go for good, high quality vintage cast iron. I love the stuff.

When you heat the pan it releases some of the silica, making the surface slippery.  When the silica‚Äôs all gone, the pan will longer be nonstick.  You have to throw it out and buy a new one.

Copper pans are not non-stick.  Some nonstick pans have a copper colored coating, but it‚Äôs just a marketing gimmick.  They are either Teflon coated or ceramic coated like green pan.

Every day, every student who finished all or most of their lunch will be given a sticker. A teacher or lunch monitor will be in charge of keeping track. The rewards can be anything the school sees fit like extra recess time, school-wide recognition, school supplies, or gift cards for higher grades.

Reuse: Organize regular art and craft sessions where students can create new items from the collected materials like sculptures, toys, decorations, and functional items like storage containers. Host competitions where students can showcase their creations, with categories like ""Most Creative,"" ""Best Use of Materials,"" and ""Most Functional.‚Äù Display the projects in a school exhibition or gallery to celebrate the students' efforts and spread awareness.

Recycle: Each recycling bin is a different color depending on the recycled material. Each time a student finishes their lunch, they take a turn trying to throw their recyclable trash right into the bin. Each successful throw into the correct bin earns one point. You could even add bonus points for students who properly sort multiple items at once. A student volunteer or lunch monitor will keep track of the points. At the end of lunch, the one with the highest score has their name up on the board as the Recycle Master for the rest of the day. Consider offering small eco-friendly prizes, like reusable water bottles or tote bags, for weekly or monthly top scorers.

Do you have any suggestions to improve them?",,1,sustainability,2025-01-14 07:15:55,ideas encouraging students sustainable school,come three ideas encourage students reduce reuse recycle order reduce give student reward manage finish lunch instead wasting sticker board put cafeteria names student every day every student finished lunch given sticker teacher lunch monitor charge keeping track rewards anything school sees fit like extra recess time school wide recognition school supplies gift cards higher grades reuse organize regular art craft sessions students create new items collected materials like sculptures toys decorations functional items like storage containers host competitions students showcase creations categories like creative best use materials functional display projects school exhibition gallery celebrate students efforts spread awareness recycle recycling bin different color depending recycled material time student finishes lunch take turn trying throw recyclable trash right bin successful throw correct bin earns one point could even add bonus points students properly sort multiple items student volunteer lunch monitor keep track points end lunch one highest score name board recycle master rest day consider offering small eco friendly prizes like reusable water bottles tote bags weekly monthly top scorers think ideas suggestions improve,

Environmental impact of glass vs acrylic mirrors?,"What has the greater environmental impact, glass or plastic mirrors?

Google search gave me a massive wad of misinformation, AI slop and biased sources (manufacturers advertising their products).  I've seen only low quality sources that either focus too heavily on one aspect and/or do not actually *quantify* environmental impacts... like the usual *plastic bad*, or focusing only on the higher energy cost to produce glass.  I want a holistic, factual analysis, not just impressions!

Things to consider:

* Energy cost of producing glass vs. acrylic - my understanding is acrylic is lighter, but by how much?
* Energy cost of recycling - glass costs more, but can be recycled more times.  
* Longevity and durability
* Potential impacts of disposal - microplastics for acrylic, metallic aluminum backing for glass, etc.
* Energy cost of transportation (weight)
* Packaging materials - plastic film for acrylic, foam padding/bubble wrap etc. for glass
* Material extractions and transportation - sand for glass, petrochemicals for acrylic
* What else?

Context:

* In this specific scenario, the mirrors are to be adhered to furniture and it's unlikely they will ever be recyclable
* I'm talking about cheap, standard mirrors, although if there's a more expensive version that uses more sustainable manufacturing practices or something, I guess that's interesting!
* Let's assume we have zero control over the energy sources used in the life cycle of either product, and they're likely fossil fuel based",,1,sustainability,2025-01-05 06:56:18,environmental impact glass vs acrylic mirrors,greater environmental impact glass plastic mirrors google search gave massive wad misinformation ai slop biased sources manufacturers advertising products seen low quality sources either focus heavily one aspect actually quantify environmental impacts like usual plastic bad focusing higher energy cost produce glass want holistic factual analysis impressions things consider energy cost producing glass vs acrylic understanding acrylic lighter much energy cost recycling glass costs recycled times longevity durability potential impacts disposal microplastics acrylic metallic aluminum backing glass etc energy cost transportation weight packaging materials plastic film acrylic foam padding bubble wrap etc glass material extractions transportation sand glass petrochemicals acrylic else context specific scenario mirrors adhered furniture unlikely ever recyclable talking cheap standard mirrors although expensive version uses sustainable manufacturing practices something guess interesting let assume zero control energy sources used life cycle either product likely fossil fuel based,
Why do environmentalists overlook Animal Agriculture?,"Animal agriculture is the largest driver of environmental destruction, yet it receives far less attention from environmental activists compared to issues like transportation or renewable energy. While these topics are important, their environmental impact pales in comparison to the effects of animal agriculture.

Advocacy that ignores such a significant factor risks being performative rather than impactful.","Have you been hiding under a rock and covering your ears and eyes?

Environmentalists are very aware and very vocal about the effects of industrial scale cattle farming.  There are plenty of documentaries, movies, books, and YouTube specials about it. || you seem to be confusing environmentalists with politicians and political and economic organizations like the world bank or WTO

its easy and costs them nothing to say we should simply switch ICE cars for electric or build some BRT or metro lines, its easy to say hey lets build some solar farms or give some solar tax rebates.

its wayyyyy harder to say ""hey the western diet is fundamentally not sustainable, and most change"".

the general public would crucify a major politician saying that, because although its factually true, people simply don't want to give up what they like.

its like with factory farming, huge numbers of people at least have a vague idea of how fucked up industrial factory farms are.... and yet they still continue to eat meat; its a lot easier to try and just not think about it than to fundamentally change your diet

actual environmentalists talk about it all the time, people like politicians and the media or celebrities don't, because they aren't even willing to do it themselves || I disagree with your premise that environmentalists overlook animal agriculture. || You have the power. Stop eating animal products. Stop supporting the industry. || In my experience, it's because everyone is for the environment until it comes to them having to change their own  lifestyle.  For those in my life who are the most outspoken about the environment, I give them them a copy of Glenn Merzer's book Food is Climate.  At least that takes care of the ignorance around the drastic impact of animal agriculture on the environment, which there seems to be a lot of as well. || Agro forestry is a huge part of the environmental movement. If you why don‚Äôt you see it, that is likely because you don‚Äôt or didn‚Äôt care. Our news and feeds are very influenced by personal algorithms. || Agricultural lobby is very powerful.  See the documentary ""Cowspiracy"" üêÑ || I am not fully sure I accept the premise of your question that ""Animal agriculture is the largest driver of environmental destruction...""

What's your basis for this? 

Composite energy usage (meaning everything from transportation to building construction to heat and electricity usage, industrial combustion, etc.) makes up over 70% of greenhouse gases and is damaging in other ways. Agriculture (and not just animal agriculture) is at like 11-12%.  Which one would have the greater environmental impact by addressing its issues?

And that is not to say agriculture is not being addressed at all.  As someone else pointed out, regenerative agriculture is a movement. || In my experience, they don't. I do think there could be a stronger effort made towards a more effective message. Rather than blaming environmental destruction on animal agriculture (which can make people defensive), recommend reducing meat consumption to a couple times a week and/or switching to chicken/poultry for the health benefits with the added bonus of more environmentally friendly diet. || I care about the environment and I am vegan because of it. Well, it started with that to eat plant based and then went vegan for animals. While I am not a perfect vegan actually, I try my best to consume everything vegan, but sometimes sustainability comes first like second hand clothes and I am not fully aware if it is real leather or not. 

While there are people who care about environment aren‚Äôt fully vegan, they usually at least do think about it. For example, I talked to one girl that is vegetarian but will eat meat pizza if her friends would throw it out otherwise for example || In the words of Billy Bragg, ‚ÄúIf no one out there understands, start your own revolution and cut out the middle man.‚Äù || Is it possible you woke up about animal agriculture? || I agree w other comments here but am wondering what you are thinking about doing about the issue. The more voices we have, the more likely we can make change! || While the tides are changing, I find historically most people interested in environmentalism are wanting to maintain their current level of consumption but in a ""greener"" way. There is no greener way to eat animals since such practices are always destructive, hence animal ag is largely ignored as unsolvable, something we just have to live with.

The immediate solution is personal behavioral changes by no eating animals, which is extremely hard to convince others to do. We all here know how hard it is to convince someone to consume less. The current alternative of plant-based meats is also difficult to adopt given expansive marketing against those products by animal ag, plus the cozy relationship animal ag has with the government through lobbying and subsidies. || because that means they would have to change their actions to be ethically consistent. join us at r/vegancirclejerk || In the film Cowspiracy the guy is interviewing the head of an organization and when he asks the guy why they don't advise their donors not to consume meat, the guy becomes quite uncomfortable and ends the interview.   The fact of the matter is most people don't want to change their consumption of animal products and advising them to do so if they are concerned about the environment tends to piss them off or result in dubious whack-a-mole self-justifications which can be tiresome to address..

""...the participants in this study repeated several commonly-held viewpoints in environmental and sustainability science. As a result, their justifications for eating meat weren‚Äôt contradictory, but rather aligned with their pre-existing beliefs.""

How Can We Achieve a Balance Between Urban Development and Environmental Preservation?,"As cities grow, so does their environmental impact. How do you think we can create urban spaces that foster sustainable growth and allow nature to thrive side by side with development?","buddy it is building codes and zoning laws. 

The ""environmental impact"" of cities comes from having people in them, but *per capita* it's better than ""green"" rural areas, because you 1) aren't conditioning as much space per person, and 2) and traveling as far to do everything.

So then building codes need to ensure that adding density is also at a high standard of sustainability, and zoning laws need to actually allow new construction of housing. ""Nature thriving side by side with development"" doesn't look like a big yard with a tree in it, it looks like an exurban forest not being clearcut because there are vacancies in the city for people to move into. || Build dense apartment blocks and nuke the suburbs. || Here are some I am a big proponent of: 

- Restrict HOAs from creating ordinances on lawn appearance and allow homeowners to create native habitat
- Ban the sale of invasive species
- Pass laws requiring government agencies to use native plants in landscaping.  Any government funding for landscaping projects also needs to adhere to this
- Put restrictions on pesticides use
- Create wildlife corridors within cities and suburbs that allow wildlife to move freely from one patch of land to another
- Promote native crops
- prioritize walking and biking infrastructure to reduce the reliance on building new roads.  This includes building more mixed use communities to foster walkability
- incentivize higher density building.

Best Use of Personal Funds to Reduce Environmental Impact: Where Should I Donate?,"Hi everyone,  
I‚Äôm exploring how to make the most impactful use of my money to support the environment and wanted to get your thoughts.

I already live a low-impact lifestyle and recently started a new job, giving me the financial flexibility to support some projects that would further reduce my impact. I‚Äôve been looking into carbon offsets and wondering how they compare to donating to charities or foundations.

Offsets seem more direct since you‚Äôre paying per ton of CO2 reduced or removed, while charities tackle broader systemic issues but can be harder to measure in terms of direct impact. I‚Äôve also read a bunch about the legitimacy of some offset projects but have also seen some fantastic ones that I would genuinely want to support.

What do you think?

* Are offsets inherently more impactful especially with the goal to reduce personal impact, or do charities provide unique value?
* How do you decide where to allocate your money for the biggest difference?
* Any trustworthy offset projects or charities you‚Äôd recommend?

Cars,"I'm driving an 08' odyssey with a slow battery drain that burns oil. I need a new car. I have been ""shopping"" for months, and I cannot figure out what to buy. We were going to buy a Kia EV6 but there are so many recalls, and issues with batteries.

I spent 1 year trying to figure out my slow battery drain on my Honda, and I don't want to go back to having to jump my vehicle because it is unreliable.   Everything I read says that EVs are better than hybrids, but do we really know this?  We know most Prius's will last for many years, but do we really know EVs will last as long?  And from what I can tell, all of the Evs have tons of recalls. Many with serious issues. If there were any hydrogen stations near me, I'd explore this option, but it isn't real yet....

I need a dependable car. I also need a 5-seater. If we go with a Prius, we'd need a Prius Prime- a plug in.  I'm know plug in hybrids are the worst, but we can put in a charger at home, and we can use it almost as if it were an EV, but it has two batteries, so double the resources.  My car will be the ""bigger"" family car, and I want something small.  Our old civic got 32 miles per gallon (it was a manual). It is crazy to me that a hybrid will get like 42.

I just want to buy the most sustainable car for a family of 5 that is reliable. Is there such a thing? We always buy used, and I am thinking we'll pick up a 'newer"" car (24 or 23)?

Bonus points for something that isn't ugly! I've been driving a van since '09 and I want something sleek. I need a quick to 60 to get on the road into the city as well!

So seriously, ideas as to the most sustainable, reliable vehicle for a family of 5?

My reasoning for wanting to eat insects is that I rarely consume meat and animal products, largely for sustainability's sake, and I find it is difficult to always get enough protein every day (please don't argue about how easy it is/give solutions unrelated to bugs in response to this post).

I've heard insects are a sustainable source of protein, so I'm trying to evaluate whether insect consumption could actually be practically implemented in my everyday life.

I have some queries though....

Are crickets the best sort of insect to eat? I personally, however irrationally, would prefer to eat things that are less wriggly and worm-like, and certainly nothing slimy, so things like mealworms are probably out of the question.

Firstly, as a source of protein, are crickets/insects actually that worthwhile? Do crickets/insects actually provide more protein/gram than natural plant-based sources of protein such as lentils etc. If I would have too regularly consume an ungodly ammount of crickets/insects, then I am uninterested, as part of the reason I'm seeking unconventional protein sources other than meat etc is because I want to get enough protein from a relatively normal diet without eating loads of one thing in one go. 

Secondly - how would I source edible insects, such as crickets, affordably and sustainably? The only insects I could find online that are sold for human consumption are being sold as a gimmick, because not enough people want to eat insects for it to be commercially viable otherwise. As a result they're prohibitively expensive for me. It seems a bit strange, and potentially unsafe, to consume insects intended for purposes such as reptile feed. Are my concerns unfounded? 

What's the feasability of farming crickets myself? 

Any advice or knowledge would be much appreciated! Also, I'm aware that this subject seems to make some people very angry (food actually appears to be an extremely culturally sensitive subject, interestingly) so please remember that I am not the personification of any cultural movement or view of life that you may disagree with. 

Thanks :)







","I think this is a really niche market at this point but I applaud you for exploring the subject. Someone has to! I‚Äôm commenting so I can see if you get any valuable responses. I think transitioning away from meat is very important but I prefer to swap to beans and lentils. Far more palatable, and delicious even. || Lobsters are pretty tasty, but my wife insists they *aren't bugs!! 1!one!*

I insist otherwise. And it's just one of those things where we agree to disagree. || As far as I know, cricket protein powder is the most accessible and pragmatic way of using insects for nutrition on the market currently. || It is still more sustainable to eat plants. Unless you live somewhere that eats bugs traditionally, the notion that climate activist expect people to eat bugs is nothing more than a right wing talking point. This is anti climate propaganda on a climate sub. || I ate crickets 12 years ago and then again about 3 years ago 
There was a brand of snack that was sold in Sainsbury's Local (a chain of supermarkets in the UK) for a while.

The first time it was a really niche restaurant experience where it was served on some weird dry ice inside a terrarium on a straw bed. The straw tasted like it had more flavor. Because I don't find crickets particularly flavorsome at all. They're quite hollow once they've been cooked and honestly taste of nothing. A light crunch, then thin air. 

The snack packs were better because they were at least cooked in spices which gave it a bit more volume and much more flavor than just crickets tossed in a frying pan. 

I even got my father who was in his 70s at the time to more or less chomp down a whole pack, before I told them what they were.

...and the comedy ensued.

Definitely worth exploring more of them. Because of course, plenty of tribes have exited on this stuff for centuries so it shouldn't be particularly medically controversial in any way. Plus chimps eat raw ants for the protein. 

The main problem you have for a western palate though, is that the cooking process itself leads to the insects splitting open and much of the protein (all the innards) leak out, fluids evaporate and the protein residue is left in the pan. So while raw, they're a reasonable source of protein, the fact you'd cook them, loses the protein. || [deleted]",6,sustainability,2024-12-24 22:18:09,seeking advice eating insects,interested idea eating insects sustainable lifestyle choice even makes sound like stereotypical evil liberal right wing fantasy remember trying dried crickets certainly edible seasoning cooked recipes could delicious reasoning wanting eat insects rarely consume meat animal products largely sustainability sake find difficult always get enough protein every day please argue easy give solutions unrelated bugs response post heard insects sustainable source protein trying evaluate whether insect consumption could actually practically implemented everyday life queries though crickets best sort insect eat personally however irrationally would prefer eat things less wriggly worm like certainly nothing slimy things like mealworms probably question firstly source protein crickets insects actually worthwhile crickets insects actually provide protein gram natural plant based sources protein lentils etc would regularly consume ungodly ammount crickets insects uninterested part reason seeking unconventional protein sources meat etc want get enough protein relatively normal diet without eating loads one thing one go secondly would source edible insects crickets affordably sustainably insects could find online sold human consumption sold gimmick enough people want eat insects commercially viable otherwise result prohibitively expensive seems bit strange potentially unsafe consume insects intended purposes reptile feed concerns unfounded feasability farming crickets advice knowledge would much appreciated also aware subject seems make people angry food actually appears extremely culturally sensitive subject interestingly please remember personification cultural movement view life may disagree thanks,think really niche market point applaud exploring subject someone commenting see get valuable responses think transitioning away meat important prefer swap beans lentils far palatable delicious even lobsters pretty tasty wife insists bugs one insist otherwise one things agree disagree far know cricket protein powder accessible pragmatic way using insects nutrition market currently still sustainable eat plants unless live somewhere eats bugs traditionally notion climate activist expect people eat bugs nothing right wing talking point anti climate propaganda climate sub ate crickets years ago years ago brand snack sold sainsbury local chain supermarkets uk first time really niche restaurant experience served weird dry ice inside terrarium straw bed straw tasted like flavor find crickets particularly flavorsome quite hollow cooked honestly taste nothing light crunch thin air snack packs better least cooked spices gave bit volume much flavor crickets tossed frying pan even got father time less chomp whole pack told comedy ensued definitely worth exploring course plenty tribes exited stuff centuries particularly medically controversial way plus chimps eat raw ants protein main problem western palate though cooking process leads insects splitting open much protein innards leak fluids evaporate protein residue left pan raw reasonable source protein fact cook loses protein deleted
Is True Sustainability Achievable Without Reimagining Human-Nature Relationships?,"Most sustainability efforts focus on energy, food, and waste management, but are we overlooking the deeper connections between our societies and ecosystems?

If you are so inclined, you could change your diet for sustainability- I don‚Äôt think it gets more peaceful than that in terms of peaceful activism ideas you‚Äôre asking for (: 

If anyone has questions about going vegan, or how to transition to a plant based diet, I‚Äôm happy to help. Lots of documentaries to recommend too if anyone is interested‚Ä¶People make jokes on the vegan subs about getting downvoted here and the climate change sub when they dare to mention veganism in terms of sustainability, so I‚Äôll probably get downvoted‚Ä¶ but a girl‚Äôs gotta try. Call it my peaceful environmental activism for the day lol. 

Every single time you eat, you make a choice. You vote with each bite. Put your money where your mouth is (: || Part of creating change is being disruptive. Being peaceful, especially at this point, will not do anything except ensure the status quo. Good luck || In my area, we have ‚Äúcommunity gifting‚Äù groups you can join.  They are hyper local and neighbors can give away stuff they do not need for free.  It‚Äôs an amazing way to reduce and reuse || Look at Drawdown solutions website, the first action is to stop food waste (which is fairly easy and will save you money), and then Educate people around you. For instance try to attend a Climate Fresk, a game for people to learn and talk about climate change. It‚Äôs great, almost 2 million played it worldwide but in the US it‚Äôs 100000% more needed than in Europe. 
I organize free sessions at the library, in schools, in events‚Ä¶ and everybody learns something, has an idea of something to do at their level at the end, and has a good time! || Lead by example. 

Sell your car: ride a bike or use transit. 

Stop eating meat: eat legumes in public.

Give up consumerism: slow fashion, hand made gifts, upcyle everything. || The only massive scale activism that can be organized ‚Äòin time‚Äô, in my opinion, is the mayday protest 2028. 

Which is quite close in my estimation to labor strikes‚Äô value being eradicated by ai, so it will be for everything.

While climate should absolutely be on of our 5 or however many red line demands, if we can remove big money from politics and provide healthcare, we‚Äôll be in a position to go all out in electing a true leader and a majority to deliver what‚Äôs been taken. 

I have looked up and considered more extreme activism, and will continue doing so, but it is fraught with negative impacts on the movement. Wed almost need an inside person, which wouldn‚Äôt be possible as they‚Äôd have to be a sociopath. 

I would be preparing for the events we are not preparing for as a country, and strongly considering what you would do without power or stores for multiple weeks.

Besides that, just keep thinking, desperate times occasionally lead to breakthroughs. Trees always being planted always is a good idea. Grassroots to Congress we need representatives to reject corporate money and fight for the people || In my opinion, we need a mix of different approaches. We need the disruptive marches and throwing soup at the class in front of a painting. We also need the marches which have been liaised with the police, and the people writing to their representatives, and the people disrupting the fancy dinners of oil and gas companies, and the people challenging governments and companies in the law courts.

You could look at the Earth Hero app - https://www.earthhero.org/en_GB/

It‚Äôs been developed with climate scientists, and provides suggestions for individual actions we can take to reduce our own climate impact and collective actions we can take to promote systemic change, with a range of different suggested groups to join. || Some people dont see what is possible in their workplace, in their company or organisation. Pushing from inside where you know how things are done can have a greater effect because you know how things could be done better. People often underestimate their power as an employee and also that there might be colleagues who think the same. || Get a job. . . 

No really, get a green job, get a degree in sustainability; help companies see that sustainability is good business!

Fight from the inside, if you can convince companies they will make/save money by being more sustainable you can make big changes quickly. 

An example of this is ProLogis; a logistics company that handles 2.5% of the ENTIRE WORLDS GDP; is installing solar panels on all their new warehouses and selling the energy to the tenants. . . They make bank all while reducing carbon emissions.

Influencing individuals is great, but getting companies to change is where you can really make a difference. || Ir order of impact and easy adoption.

Being child free, car free, and going vegan. The combined outcome of those 3 is huge. 

Going off-grid, growing your own food, and going zero-waste also helps, but it's way more difficult to achieve short-term. It could be a long-term goal or retirement strategy with friends/partners.

Adopting minimalism, consciously buying or going full anti-consumption also helps. As a rule of thumb, the most ecological purchase is the one you don't make. If something is really needed, then do this checklist:

Use your stuff until it is worn out beyond repair > Use what you already have > borrow/share > swap   > make/build/recycle/repair/repurpose > thrift > buy new as a last resort.

Before buying anything, think in advance about the materials used and the carbon footprint, repairability, durability, how to recycle it, or dispose of it.

If you have free time or disposable income, volunteer or donate to conservation projects. || Tbh, look what their already is. I know activists who have spent their entire lives campaigning, and are in their 70s. || Grow a garden. Learn about rocket mass heaters. || as an individual trying to change lifestyle to a 5 ton CO2 footprint a year... there are many means

Are you using a lot of plastic?  Putting cans into the landfill?  Driving cars constantly and thus polluting the atmosphere?  Eating meat (yes, this has an environmental implication)?   When you achieve buying power, then are you choosing clean energy?  Do you fly in airplanes rather than take trains, ships or buses?  Do you ride a bicycle when feasible?

How do you all deal with working in climate-unfriendly sectors?,"Hello all. I work in a manufacturing facility in which a large portion of our customers are within the oil and gas sector. I consider myself to be climate-conscious, but I have taken a renewed look at my personal impact in light of recent political events. Is it possible to strike a balance between my overall values and the seemingly obvious contradiction in my line of work? I have been trying to make my workplace more sustainable (reusable water bottles, reducing waste, etc) but it feels kinda crappy manufacturing stuff for a sector that is not really great for the environment. Please let me know what you think:)","What kind of work do you do, concretely? With your background, can you transition to similar work without the oil and gas connection?

They may not be interested in a climate focus, but Climate-friendly outcomes can be lumped into many general conservation, resiliency, and efficiency improvements without even mentioning the word ‚Äúclimate‚Äù.  Water quality improvements, forest health, aesthetics, it‚Äôs all tied together.  In a manufacturing environment a reduction of waste can save money and landfill space.  Recycling can be smart business.  Find out about options with your waste management company.  Call them, look around the facility for some idea of what large-scale savings can be made with minor changes to production.  Consider others in the company that will champion your efforts, or at the very least will not undermine it.  Any cost or efficiency improvements you can recommend should be appreciated.  There‚Äôs a marketing benefit to all this as well.  DEQ, any regulatory agencies that your company deals with may also be good partners.  Thanks for your interest, I wish you well. || Technology isn't inherently evil, but ours is currently purely instrumental. It's our lack of intention applying technology to the question (after having answered it), ""What is our purpose? Where are we going, and why?"" Our lack of this understanding or willingness to confront these questions on the larger cultural scale, is the problem.

If it meets your needs allowing you to provide for and encourage family and friends to make better choices, you remain proactive, and you truly see potential for green growth in the future, as long as you're increasing consciousness, prodding people to ask those bigger questions,  ""Why this vs that? Why profit over safety? Why more instead of contentment? Why control over acceptance?"" I'll remain glad to know you're in that position, rather than anyone else.

You are not creating additional waste, since somebody else would just be doing it in your place if you didn‚Äôt work there, and all the initiatives and changes you make are net positives that somebody else might not have made.

Leather Vs vegan leather,"Hey, 
I've stop consuming meat 1 year ago for ecological reasons. I'm happy that a side effect is animal well-being, but it isn't the mainreason why I do it.
I've been recently asking myself if vegan leather is really more ecological than animal leather.
Because I've done a bit of research and animal leather object has approximately a 3 times higher environmental impact at production BUT it tends to last a lot longer. 
So I don't know if at the end, if I have to buy 3 items of vegan (I buy plant based not plastic/petrol) leather, is it really less poluant than buying once an animal leather item. Even more because I buy most things second hand...

If anyone has an opinion on this it would help me a lot!
Thanks everyone ü´∂","Hello! While we are happy to host this conversation, if anyone is interested in more talk about veganism and zero waste, you should also check out /r/PlantBased4ThePlanet and /r/ZeroWasteVegans!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/ZeroWaste) if you have any questions or concerns.* || I limit myself to second hand real leather.

Yes, an animal still died to make the shoes / bag, but at least it‚Äôll last decades and isn‚Äôt funding the oil industry and shedding microplastics everywhere.

It‚Äôs a bit greenwashy, but there‚Äôs no perfect solution. || No, there's no winning on this discussion as both sides make valid arguments.  Save time by looking into waxed-canvas alternatives || Vegan leather is plastic. Period. Plus it‚Äôs usually pretty garbage quality, so it flakes easily, adding more pollution all over the place and people won‚Äôt buy it second-hand if it‚Äôs falling apart. 

I buy my leather (other than my shoes) second hand. The animal has already been slaughtered and I can‚Äôt bring it back, but I can continue to give the garment life. Plus, it‚Äôs already broken in so I don‚Äôt have to do the work, now I just get to be a steward of the garment and take care of it, hopefully to pass it along in the distant future. Vegan leather MAY make it to next year.

Edited to add: I have a leather Michael Kor‚Äôs billfold I bought YEARS ago before I went low-waste, and it still looks brand-new. I have a MK leather handbag I bought at Goodwill about 5 years ago and it still looks near new (except for the place where my ex‚Äôs puppy chewed a corner a little). I bought a vintage Dooney & Burke leather handbag 15+ years ago, gifted it to my aunt who wore it daily for 2 years because D&B was her dream bag, then my cousin (her daughter) kept it with my blessing after my aunt passed. It also still looks new. All of those pieces will likely outlive me if I take care of them, and most of them were second-hand. || I'm a vegan, and I'm in favor of buying leather if another sustainable option isn't available (assuming we're talking leather that's a by-product of the meat industry). Better to purchase one quality bag or jacket that lasts you decades than a new  'leather' version every two years while the old one goes in the landfill. Plant based leathers still often have plastic in them to extend their lifespan and cut costs, anyway :(

I buy second-hand leather every chance I get. || I'm choosing leather, but only from companies that source it in an ethical manner. For example, Jim Green uses wild buffalo leather sourced from animals removed from local reserves for population and disease control. Their shoes can also be resoled, which extends the life span of the product. || I have worked in leather industry to transition to sustainable practices and I can tell you, leather these days is becoming sustainable. Less water usage, low chemicals, effective filtration processes, you name it. If you are interested in getting certified leather which is sustainability produced then check for LWG leather, that way you will be content to know that the product has followed all diligences. || If you absolutely need leather aesthetic or function, use real leather. ‚ÄúVegan leather‚Äù, even the ones made with plant material, are held together by plastics/polymers as a stabilizer, and degrade over time. There are a few that try to stay more natural, like mushroom leather, but even those aren‚Äôt 100% 

If you want to be the most earth friendly you can be, aim for veg tan leather. It isn‚Äôt as soft as chrome tanned, but it is a bit tougher. Chrome tanned leather is better now than it used to be (DuckFeet boots, for example, use a chrome tanned leather that is rated for being one of the most earth friendly options available), but I‚Äôll admit I still have a bias for veg tanned leather. A veg tanned leather that has gained traction in recent years is olive tanned leather, which (as implied) uses olive leaves to tan leather hides, and is considered very earth friendly.

That being said, if you want to stick to being vegan, there are a lot of applications where you can comfortably swap leather for wool, canvas, or a waxed canvas.

Warmth: wool. Allbirds, for example, makes some great wool sneakers. I will admit I wish wool was a more commonly used material, I love it.

Canvas: is breathable, lightweight, and tough! Perfect for shoes, bags, padding material, and more!

Waterproof: waxed canvas. Basically, give the canvas or wool fabric a nice layer of beeswax mixed with other oils to soften it (leather protectant wax like Obenauf‚Äôs or Smith‚Äôs are fantastic options. You can make your own by mixing Beeswax with other oils and scents). This wax can be applied to shoes, jackets, cloaks, hoods, bags, and more to make it more water resistant. Keep in mind, though, this does reduce breathability to some extent.

Finally, consider 2 things:

1. If you buy second hand, you aren‚Äôt contributing to the leather industry, and thereby it‚Äôs perfectly Ok

2. Cow Leather is a byproduct of the meat industry, meaning more cow-hide is made than ends up getting sold to tanneries and turned into leather. Effectively, when you buy leather, no extra cows are killed because of your purchase. If you buy an exotic leather (stingray, fox, rabbit, etc), then you probably end up supporting some less than ethical practices that ultimately kill animals specifically for the leather. If you do want exotic leathers, maybe consider leathers from invasive species, like pythons caught in Florida. Also consider leathers from animals that may have population booms every few years (kangaroos, for example, are endangered, but every few years the population explodes enough that the Australian government sanctions some hunting for them). 

As for cows, though: no extra cows are killed because of your purchase of leather products || Vintage leather- not more plastic or new production of more plastic particles! || my reasoning is this. the animals are slaughtered anyway and using their leather is better than it being wasted . also something in leather if you take care of it a minimum will last you a lifetime. || I invested in my leather Dr. Martens a ways back and my little bunny bit them (in attempts to move them out of her way) ü§£ so now there's a little slit at the top I've gotta fix. || Ive been veg for over 20 years, vegan for some of that, and have always had a complicated relationship with this question. Most recently, I have decided that second hand is the best way to go about it. Vegan leather is usually just a plastic, and it will disintegrate (ive had it happen. ) I would never buy a leather jacket new, but if I found the perfect fit at a second hand store, or from a friend, or what have you, my conscience is fine with it. Keeping more shit out of the landfill, both the vegan jacket I didnt buy and the used leather jacket I did. || I'm vegan and won't buy leather for ethical reasons. I haven't really encountered any situations where I feel I *need* something leather-like, rather for clothes, shoes etc there are good natural fibre alternatives for the things I use/need in my life. I do however have some vegan leather products from Vegetarian Shoes, as they're really high quality.and well constructed, not the kind with a thin shiny plastic layer over the top that scratches off easily. Considering all the plastic used in everyday life for most people, I'm definitely content with some boots that will last 10+ years, but incorporate some plastic. I hope natural alternatives get better developed in future, but it's right now a compromise I'm happy with! || I'm waiting for widespread mycelium leather personally. There's a phone case company called FLIPT that makes phone cases out of mycelium leather. When I get a new phone, I'll definitely be picking one up. || I don't think there's a perfect answer between vegan or animal leather. Unless and until the lifetime of v.leather improves, just get whatever is practical for your purpose. Particularly if the item creates a lot of waste besides the leather portion, then I favor real leather because it'll outlive me || I have a leather jacket I was gifted when I was 16. I‚Äôm 32 now and it‚Äôs as good as new in my opinion, maybe became a bit softer. I‚Äôm pretty sure my daughters will be able to wear it when they grow up if they so desire. Pleather (vegan leather) often doesn‚Äôt last 2 seasons (once it starts flaking off that‚Äôs it) || Secondhand real leather is my preference. I mean, I really don't feel the need to own much leather, but I do have a jacket and a pair of shoes that I got secondhand and when you take care of them, they last so very long. I work in a secondhand shop and we get so many leather handbags, jackets, pants, boots....so much leather already exists in the world and using that is definitely the best option. || Vegan leather is not an environmentally sound product it's a plastic.  The material is usually made out of either polyurethane or PVC which are major sources of microplastics which are an environmental catastrophe.

Leather itself is a waste product put to use. Leather is a biproduct of the meat industry, hence why it's most often its cow despite most flesh can be converted to it via tannins, so the environmental impact of leather is negligible it offsets the meat. You won't stop people eating meat so you may as well use all of the animal instead of pumping out more plastic. || Look into cactus leather! I have no idea how easy it is to find or how expensive it is, but I remember that my fashion designer friend started making belts out of this because she was looking for leather alternatives || Consider if there are alternative materials altogether to choose from for the item you are buying. If you're looking for a wallet for example, consider something like Kevlar which is extremely durable. If you need waterproof hiking books consider something like GoreTex -- the outsole is going to wear out before anything else will. You can get shoes made from canvas and other fabrics etc etc",25,ZeroWaste,2025-08-30 17:35:08,leather vs vegan leather,hey stop consuming meat year ago ecological reasons happy side effect animal

"Celestial Seasonings: Deception, indifference or both?","Deception or indifference? What do you think about Celestial Seasonings, obfuscation of it's plastic tea bag pouch, buy covering it in paper? This is total hypocrisy to me! This pouch, which is used inside of it's paper box of tea bags, is problematic because paper laminate to plastic can't be separated and therefore can't be recycled. Many people want to do the right thing and recycle everything they can, but in the case of this plastic pouch, they have no idea that it is a plastic bag because it is made to look and feel like recyclable paper. These pouches are contaminates in the paper recycling process and muck things up, causing more waste. A fully paper pouch would not cause this problem, and/or an obvious plastic pouch could be separated from regular recyclables, and discarded properly.

","Fun fact, celestial seasonings has cult origins! With aliens! And eugenics! || That‚Äôs disappointing!!

How to avoid plastic in your tea:
Choose other brands:
Opt for brands that are known to use plastic-free tea bags, such as Traditional Medicinals or Numi Teas. 
Switch to loose-leaf tea:
Use loose-leaf tea with a metal or glass infuser for a completely plastic-free brewing experience. || It's really a shame that this is so common. I only do loose-leaf now that I buy from a local company because I don't want micro plastics from teabags in my compost. I would email them and complain. As useless as it sounds, I've actually gotten great responses from companies before who genuinely did change their packaging after I messaged them. || Thanks for posting this. I have been using this brand thinking the bags and the additional packaging is mostly compostable. Will switch to something else, possibly loose-leaf. || Unless a brand was made with zero waste in mind since the beginning not sure why you think they start caring about it now || If you really wanted to be low-waste or zero-waste, you would already be drinking loose-leaf tea. Unless they‚Äôre advertising ‚Äúplastic-free packaging‚Äù or ‚Äúfully recyclable‚Äù or something, they‚Äôre not engaging in hypocrisy either. || Did you know the CelestialSeasoning tea bags also have plastic in them?

"I bought this bar of face soap packaged in cardboard, but then it came wrapped in plastic on the inside again‚Ä¶","I‚Äôm very new to zero wasting I am so so so so far away from living a less wasteful lifestyle, but I‚Äôm trying to incorporate the little things bit by bit, but I just feel like I keep on getting bamboozled ü•≤ The packaging never claimed it was plastic free but I assumed it‚Äôs a bar of soap why should it need plastic. I assumed WRONG. Very very frustrating, but oh well I‚Äôm just gonna use this one up and try and look for a plastic free alternative. 
","Vanicream and cerave have bar soaps for face in cardboard with no plastic! 

Advice incoming: I will say, when you‚Äôre reducing your waste (especially early on), it helps not to fixate on optimizing for every swap (ie getting the perfect product). That tiny scrap of plastic is still way way way less plastic than the plastic bottle you probably bought previously (a win!) and it‚Äôs way way less than a single bottle of water or soda you might pick up one afternoon. That is NOT meant to shame at all, but to bring some perspective. Instead of focusing so hard on the plastic your soap is wrapped in and wearing yourself out (meaning you don‚Äôt have energy for other swaps), celebrate the improvement compared to the thing you‚Äôre replacing. And then see what other areas would make a big impact on your waste.

I‚Äôm speaking from experience, and I still do this sometimes, I am an optimizer by nature. But I can be so fixated on the plastic on my hair conditioner that I buy once every 2 years, and then ignore the to-go coffee cups I get every week, you know what I mean?

My point is, sometimes you gotta say ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù and maybe you‚Äôll come back to it and get something even better, or maybe not, but it‚Äôs still a win.

Soapbox over. Thanks for reading. || This doesn‚Äòt look like plastic but some sort of paper?! Rip off a little bit and see if it dissolves in water? || Sometimes you can't go without plastic packaging especially for soaps because the producer wants to keep the bar intact just in case it's stored in a humid warehouse. You don't want to buy a bar of soap and then notice at home that a part has melted away because of moisture. || It's because if the cardboard box gets wet, the product will still be usable.  Kind of the same principle for cereals that come inside of a bag inside of a box (except their concern is also freshness).  The real waste here is actually the box, not the bag.  

But I get you ! It REALLY, SUPER doesn't make any sense when a bottle of medication comes in hard, plastic, tamper resistant/ evident bottles, which they then put in a box. || I'm a fan of [good.store](https://good.store/) for the products they sell.

Shave cream bars that work? And shampoo bottle alternatives?,"Okay I‚Äôve always felt bad using shaving cream especially since the bottle seems way less recyclable than shampoo bottles. And I tried a shaving butter bar before (it comes in a paper packaging instead) and it didn‚Äôt foam or lather up at all very well for shaving? üò≠ the one I tried was Kitsch shaving soap bar just so you know to avoid it.  

Anyone have any recommendations on ones that lather up well for shaving? I‚Äôm in the process of getting everything permanently removed with electrolysis but I still need to shave in the mean time!

Currently using L‚ÄôOr√©al thickening shampoo in the green bottle‚Äîneed something that leans on the thickening side if possible lol","Are you using a safety razor with a bristle brush to create lather or are you just rubbing the bar on yourself? If the latter, definitely buy a shaving brush and a mug if you're going to use a bar. My husband loves Barrister & Mann shaving soap.

Teachers vs sustainability,"I just started my first year teaching! I used to work at a daycare and only a few months ago got into sustainability.

Are there any other teachers working towards a sustainable goal? Is there anything you‚Äôre implementing? 

If anyone has any suggestions that would be great! Ive been keeping a bag of scrap papers that I plan on making more paper with it :) ","If you can help the kids develop good environmentally friendly beliefs and habits even from a young age that will really have a sustainable impact in the future! No advice here per se but just kudos and keep up the good work! || I seen some teacher have trash can for stuff to throw away and a box for paper that could be recycled into other stuff in there room or that could be given to art teacher if they do paper mache || If you plan to have a prize box, skip the cheap plastic toys at Dollar Tree or Target and get them secondhand instead. You can easily find a whole bunch of little toys if you search ‚Äúlot of toys‚Äù on eBay or Goodwill‚Äôs online site! || A paper scraps bin for a paper that can have another use like for crafts or scraps for notes. Keeping crayon stubs and melting them down. You can use the rubbery ice molds in shapes to make large shaped crayons. The kids can make their own color blends. || Personally my biggest complaint as a parent of elementary school kids is the amount of paper that comes home with stuff glued/taped to it so that it's no longer able to be put in my recycling bin. Every project doesn't need googly eyes or glitter. Really, almost none of them do! 

It's so hard to draw the line between little kid creativity and waste though. It would definitely make my kids sad if they could never use googly eyes again, but I wish their teachers would rein it in a lot.

Most of the other wasteful things I have been able to work around by having individual conversations with the teachers, and they're usually so responsive. Every year we have things that are ""required"" to be brought in plastic bags. I am always able to message the teacher and explain that we don't use single use plastic and my child will be bringing a reusable bag that they need to bring back home. Reusable products have been part of my household since before my kids were born, so remembering to bring them home is no problem on their end - it's the teachers and school staff that constantly need to be reminded not to throw that stuff out.

Some of my kids friends' parents, and even one teacher, have reached out to ask me about things like our Stasher snack bags, so I think it's catching on. || What grade do you teach? I would teach about sustainability at grade level. 
Also are there any programs you can get your school enrolled in?
I have NO IDEA if this is still a thing, but when I was in elementary school (1993-96) we had this program in our cafeteria that we would separate trash, food waste, and recycling. ‚Ä¶ now this was a long time ago‚Ä¶ but I think the food waste was turned into animal feed? 

Anything like that you can get at your school? Also I think 3rs grade we went to the recycling plant. 

Bless you for being a teacher. Most noble and under appreciated/paid job. || my teachers had a bin for plastic bottles, and paper instead of throwing it in the trash. and you could always use that kind of stuff so the kids can do crafts || Cool primary school projects might be - 
1.Plant seeds and grow plants in the class, the kids will have to take care of their plants and bring them home during breaks. 2. Teach about recycling, but mostly upcycling and repurposing, have bins were you collect paper, bottles and you can do art projects with them (bottles could become planters...). 3. Have little competitions where once a week you and the kids clean a little area of the backyard or the area around the school, whoever brings the biggest or heaviest bag of rubbish wins (double points if the prize is something green like a plant or something abstract like ""you choose next book we read"" rather than plasticky trinkets. 4. Show them videos and photos of dumpsters, polluted oceans, wildfires and everything that might ""traumatize"" them into not being little polluting machines. 5. Talk about the benefits of a diet with less meat and more veg, give good examples with famous people to them if needed. 6. Diy projects - l depending on the age, you can teach some basic skills to fix things or create things rather than buying stuff. 7. Cooking - how different industrial food can be from fresh stuff that is not packed in tons of plastic. I feel like you opened a pandora box in my brain, if you like these ideas, I e plenty more :) || Yes! Recycle/upcycle is great, and reducing what we use is even better! Turn off the lights, use paper not plastic, pack things in containers vs buying single serve. Challenge your students to find ways they can actively apply reduce/reuse/recycle in their daily lives. Ask them to think about things like packaging when they make their decisions, not just price or convenience. Get that critical thinking started early! Love this! || \- Tell them about the wonders of the library.

\- I like your paper scrap idea. This can be a class opportunity to teach about recycling.

\- Centre crafts around sustainability. Making a paper windmill. Using trash as materials. Maybe unraveling sweaters for fibre arts, the unraveling part is really fun to do/see and very easy if using the right garments. Making leaf confetti and doing other nature inspired crafts. Mending clothes.

\- Design/advocate for a green schoolyard. This is a big project, but it is sustainable, healthy and makes for happy children. Maybe there are some parents at the school that would like to invest time in something like this.

\- When asking children to write a story, you can use some sustainable themes. 

\- Same when reading a book to them. Choose books that are inspiring and not too consumerist. 

\- Join/ advocate for joining sustainable national/ local school activities. Like tree planting, trash pick up, recycle van (we have a plastic recycling van in the country that travels around schools and teaches about recycling), green schoolyards (maybe there is a subsidy around?), e-waste race (schools compete to collect the most e-waste).

Upcycled trash is still trash (warning: cynical post),"This is a cynical take so beware. Is it just me or.... When someone upcycles or repurposes a plastic object into art or clothing or some other useful thing... It's still gonna end up in the landfill/our environment eventually. Whether it arrives there 1 year from now or 100 years from now, we are talking about plastic, stuff that doesn't break down for hundreds of years, so by repurposing it, you delayed the inevitable, but didn't prevent the inevitable. In my mind, you're not really doing anything to solve the plastic pollution problem, right? The only way to solve that is to make things from truly biodegradable materials and to stop making things from plastic altogether. So extending the ""life"" of a plastic object doesn't actually prevent it from becoming trash at some point... Right?","That‚Äôs why the first R is reduce. It‚Äôs better to upcycle than nothing.

You needed a bag, they still aren‚Äôt in the landfill or the air (through incinerators). || Counterpoint - reusing plastic in almost any way keeps more plastic put of landfills.

Let me show you a part of my pantry. Every one of those containers you see in the front row of the middle shelf is more than 4 years old. They are all reused containers that held some sort of food product that I purchased. Even if I could afford to buy glass containers I wouldn't. Why? Because these are functional. They have lasted me for years, they are lightweight, and they didn't cost me anything. As someone living on absolutely no budget l, if I were to buy containers, it would have to be from the dollar store. I've tried that, and they absolutely did not last more than a year before chipping or cracking or warping. However these tubs (nuts from Costco that my friends buy to feed their macaw) and white bottles (coffee creamer) bottles have been in my pantry since I moved into my current house 4 years ago. And they show no sign of deteriorating.  If I had opted not to use these they would have been in the trash years ago. And probably so would multiple sets of their replacements purchased from the Dollar tree. And that is literally the opposite of zero waste, it's extremely wasteful. || There‚Äôs a lot of upcycling that prevents you from buying other (often needed items). Cleaning rags are best case. I‚Äôd like to see reusable bags only made from recycled materials. 

I wish not a single new planter pot was ever made because 80% of upcycling ideas are planter pots, And that is my upcoming project because I am getting new house plants. Which I don‚Äôt feel an urge to reduce because having several houseplants makes my indoors feel healthier.

I also need more furniture (got a bigger place) and am on the lookout for stuff I can upcycle before buying new. So definitely a way to reduce consumption.

I suppose some things are for entertainment, that are the crafts stuff. But yeah, that is cynical. Life can‚Äôt be perfectly environmental, a little fun along the way is beneficial. It‚Äôd be good if more art supplies were from recycled materials too, I think the art industry is the most wasteful because nothing is technically needed. I‚Äôm also on the hunt for old art framed to repaint over as decor, versus I was browsing blank canvases recently and didn‚Äôt buy because I‚Äôm not artsy enough to make something commercially beautiful but I am antsy enough I want to create something for enjoyment. || Yes, it's not going to fix the big problem.

But maybe I'm doing art with old plastic rather than new plastic. Maybe I'm picking it up from nature where it would be a much bigger problem than on my walls.

Upcycling trash isn't making the problem worse. I see it as a positive thing, although clearly it is in no way a solution to our pollution problem. || While your take may be accurate, it doesn‚Äôt account for the fact that systemic injustice in the world has left the majority of people several tiers lower on Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs than should be the case, so a lot of folks are doing their best to recycle and reuse when they‚Äôre not yet able to reduce. || Yeah, I've always felt this way, especially when people make mixed media art objects with trash. It's a cool way to avoid buying new materials, use what ya got and all that, but that's all it is. Nothing greater. 

I try to repurpose some things to avoid buying, like I use an old Brita pitcher with the filter removed to water my plants instead of buying a watering can. But let's be real, the amount of additional plastic waste avoided doing this is extremely minimal. We got billionaires taking 35 min jet flights out here. || China had a 5-yr program to ban disposable plastics ending in 2025 and it's worked.  Pretty much all plastic utensils and packaging from restaurants there are all biodegradable bioplastics, now.  

Honestly, we need government regulation/intervention here, too.

But meanwhile, Trump reversed the ban on plastic straws in federal agencies last year, instead... || That's why imo, we should aim to make/buy items that have long term usability (one time purchases) and to just generally reduce consumption as a whole. Though it does become tricky once you take into account how expensive long lasting items are for the general public, and how many companies sales strategy is to increase the need for repeat sales to. Turning us into forever customers.

And to add, it would be wise for any non-essential purchases/crafts you make to be something that breaks down within your lifetime and is successfuly absorbed back into nature. Making things out of trash plastics is a short term band-aid, when we need to decrease new plastic production to actually make a difference. || Here my thing trash is always gonna be a thing so might as well use it as a art material as long and it gonna be around by using trash you help make use of what already there, helps keep people from buying something new that fills the end of the upcycled item. 

Plus creativity is important for the brain Becuse it can help people distress, expression emotions, give people a voice, for example 

It better for an item to be getting used then rottening in a landfill so I think if you can extend it life your helping the planet Becuse your using something that was already made to do another job instead of getting someone to make something new to do the job that the upcycled piece now does. 

For example I made my brother a shirt quilt out of thrifted shirts for Christmas last year I kept almost 20 shirts from going to landfill and made something useful. It also kept me from buying new fabric and using water, dyes and more in the quilt Becuse of the process it takes to make new fabric, it better the t shirts are getting a second life then rottening away in some landfill.

Also for some people upcycling items into new stuff is the only way they can help with zero waste/ eco friendly stuff Becuse they don‚Äôt have enough money for reusable stuff like cotton bags or reusable water bottle like what you see in west. || actually if you make it into something useful it still trash but at least you don't buy something new instead, nevertheless in general from what I have seen it's often not the case !

and yeah better not buy these things that generate trash because it doesn't solve anything to upcycle them!

it's just like recycling is a big scam! || While this is true, you did reuse it so you prevented something else from also ending up in a land fill.

Say I cut the top off a milk jug to use as a bucket vs throwing the milk jug out and buying a bucket. So either eventually the milk jug ends up in a landfill or eventually the milk jug and the bucket end up in the landfill.

If you extend the life of plastic objects you prevent yourself from buying more plastic as you just reuse the same one you already have. || It's not technically pollution if it's an object people end up treasuring and keeping for years and years. If every single plastic objects get treated with care, then I'm not sure you can ask for more. The only reason why we are concern is because of the callousness we have with the convenience of plastic production. People seem to forget glass and ceramic can have some pretty unhealthy stuff in it like lead and cadmium. 

Plastic *has* a function and it has its place. I can weld them and melt them and fix cracks that you cannot with glass or ceramic in an almost invisible way with close to matching materials. There is a level of malleability that ""natural"" materials cannot offer. And I don't want to deal with latax / rubber because I actually want my object to last more than a year.

> you delayed the inevitable

Everything degrades inevitably, EVEN plastic. Even the microplastics you're concerned with will eventually just migrate back into everything. So with that kind of inevitably outcome, you technically can do absolutely nothing cause everything will eventually degrade. I'm not a fan of this kind of nihilistic outlook cause it makes everything you do seemingly pointless. || There is value in creation and destruction.

Is it sustainable to wear clothing and shoes that are shedding plastic?,The general idea in zerowaste is that it's better to use the thing that is already manufactured than it is to create a new item that is more sustainable. Does that apply to plastic clothing and shoes though? They are constantly shedding plastic. It seems that might be an example where sustainability does not mean using the item you already have?,"If you have plastic clothes, there's no ""away"" to throw them where the plastic will be permanently capped inside a landfill away from groundwater or oceans, because our trash goes all sorts of places we don't control. Even an actual capped landfill will eventually not be anymore. Yes, microplastics are liberated when we launder clothes, so I try to wash synthetics less often and dry them on the line rather than in the dryer. And I don't buy them anymore if I can help it. Zero waste/plastic free aren't enemies. || This is an area where you have to choice between being plastic free or zero waste cause you can‚Äôt be both 

You have to decide what the best for you.

What I mean by that is you can‚Äôt be both plastic not great for planet but keep using clothes you already have with it is zero waste, if you throw out/ dontate your clothes in order to be plastic free you won‚Äôt be zero waste since you bought you stuff before you old clothes were no longer useable || Ultimately it's going to shed plastic wherever it is and even if it's in a landfill there is no guarentee it will stay safe in there. 

The benifit to a well maintained landfill is that it's fairly contained and maybe one day some future tech or similar will allow for better processing and disposal. 

Unfortunately there just isn't the sort of data avalable to say clear cut either way. 

Certainly wearing a pair of shoes fully and then disposing of them in a properly controlled landfill is better than getting yourself two different pairs of shoes manufactured and one of them bobbing around brand new in the ocean garbage patch where waves and sun will directly deliver that plastic into the ecosystem with no benifit at all to anyone's feet. 

The issue is that reality finds itself in the middle grey area. Generally most folks perspective here is that it's best to use problematic things you already have until they are spent and then responsibly dispose of them. When you would then buy a replacement item do your best to choose something more in line with your now changed priorities. || So what are you going to do with the already existing plastic shedding clothing? Yeet them into space?¬† || What exactly is meant by constantly shedding plastic? Is that something that you can actually gauge on individual items of clothing/pairs of shoes, or are you basing this on generalizations you have read about? 

I'm not personally calling you out when I ask these questions, but I think they need to be seriously considered when we're attempting to make decisions on what to do with our clothes and shoes that contain plastics. || You need to offer a better lower cost alternative.  Wood and leather was used extensively in the past.  Large scale leather curing has supply chain & environmental issues.  Instead of leather, use cloth?

Custom wood insoles, clogs or Dutch klompen are good choices, except they aren‚Äôt flexible for use in athletic activities.  

You‚Äôre back to plastics.  Best option would be plastics that breakdown in 5 years?   Which creates continuous raw materials supply, consistent manufacturing and price increases to maintain growth rates expected by investors.  Best way to get the R&D done are strictly enforced environmental laws with substantial fines by governments.  Which ain‚Äôt happening in today‚Äôs world. || Getting rid of plastic clothing won't make it stop shedding - it will just shed somewhere else and eventually crumble into microplastic. So you might as well wear the clothes as long as you can. || I feel like more context and clarification is needed here for your thought process.

If something was already produced... I assume you mean you would buy it second hand?

For new, are you just referring to clothing or other products?

Anything you use second hand is better, 100%. Even if 'sheds'. 

It already exists, and you're getting it second hand, so you're not subjecting yourself to measured mass consumerism. 

Remember.... Even if a 'zero waste' alternative exists, it still takes energy to produce that item.

That said, when you have to buy new, 100% buy sustainable. It shows the market that we are done with the way the environment is exploited for financial gain.

Then there is a this other area of products made by recycled plastic....

I love the concept (especially considering at least in the US, recycling is a myth). That said, again if there is a product already out there you can get second hand that does what you need... Get that one 

While I want us to think about ways to recycle plastics, I also think about consumerism and how 'trendy' some of these 'we use recycled plastics ' products are. || I think you‚Äôre confusing sustainability with eco-friendliness.

The concept of sustainability has to do with minimizing the resources used, damage caused, and ability to mitigate those aspects of creation of goods. So if that‚Äôs your primary concern, then using unsustainable goods that already exist is still a more sustainable practice than retiring them early and swapping them out for goods that were sustainably produced.

That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt cases where you should consider doing that to prevent damage to the ecosystem, but that‚Äôs a case by case basis and a personal decision you have to make, and it comes with trade-offs. || Did you think this through at all before posting? || In these cases I like to consider a third angle which is promoting an unsustainable trend.

Sure it doesn't really make a difference to the environment if that specific clothing item is being worn by you or in the landfill, but if you wear it out and about, you may influence people around you who might not be so sustainable. They could see you wearing it and think, ooh that's a cool skirt and then go purchase one new in a store.

Also people who know you are sustainable might be surprised to see you wear it, and think ""huh, so-and-so is very sustainable but she doesn't have a problem with those. It must not be so bad after all."" (edit: the last sentence is the key here. I'm not saying that I only care if people think I *look* sustainable""

So in these cases I lean toward not wearing it so that I know I'm not supporting an unhealthy trend to grow in popularity.",14,ZeroWaste,2025-08-28 06:48:50,sustainable wear clothing shoes shedding plastic,general idea zerowaste better use thing already manufactured create new item sustainable apply plastic clothing shoes though constantly shedding plastic seems might example sustainability mean using item already,plastic clothes away throw plastic permanently capped inside landfill away groundwater oceans trash goes sorts places control even actual capped landfill eventually anymore yes microplastics liberated launder clothes try wash synthetics less often dry line rather dryer buy anymore help zero waste plastic free enemies area choice plastic free zero waste cause decide best mean plastic great planet keep using clothes already zero waste throw dontate clothes order plastic free zero waste since bought stuff old clothes longer useable ultimately going shed plastic wherever even landfill guarentee stay safe benifit well maintained landfill fairly contained maybe one day future tech similar allow better processing disposal unfortunately sort data avalable say clear cut either way certainly wearing pair shoes fully disposing properly controlled landfill better getting two different pairs shoes manufactured one bobbing around brand new ocean garbage patch waves sun directly deliver plastic ecosystem benifit anyone feet issue reality finds middle grey area generally folks perspective best use problematic things already spent responsibly dispose would buy replacement item best choose something line changed priorities going already existing plastic shedding clothing yeet space exactly meant constantly shedding plastic something actually gauge individual items clothing pairs shoes basing generalizations read personally calling ask questions think need seriously considered attempting make decisions clothes shoes contain plastics need offer better lower cost alternative wood leather used extensively past large scale leather curing supply chain environmental issues instead leather use cloth custom wood insoles clogs dutch klompen good choices except flexible use athletic activities back plastics best option would plastics breakdown years creates continuous raw materials supply consistent manufacturing price increases maintain growth rates expected investors best way get r done strictly enforced environmental laws substantial fines governments happening today world getting rid plastic clothing make stop shedding shed somewhere else eventually crumble microplastic might well wear clothes long feel like context clarification needed thought process something already produced assume mean would buy second hand new referring clothing products anything use second hand better even sheds already exists getting second hand subjecting measured mass consumerism remember even zero waste alternative exists still takes energy produce item said buy new buy sustainable shows market done way environment exploited financial gain area products made recycled plastic love concept especially considering least us recycling myth said product already get second hand need get one want us think ways recycle plastics also think consumerism trendy use recycled plastics products think confusing sustainability eco friendliness concept sustainability minimizing resources used damage caused ability mitigate aspects creation goods primary concern using unsustainable goods already exist still sustainable practice retiring early swapping goods sustainably produced say cases consider prevent damage ecosystem case case basis personal decision make comes trade offs think posting cases like consider third angle promoting unsustainable trend sure really make difference environment specific clothing item worn landfill wear may influence people around might sustainable could see wearing think ooh cool skirt go purchase one new store also people know sustainable might surprised see wear think huh sustainable problem must bad edit last sentence key saying care people think look sustainable cases lean toward wearing know supporting unhealthy trend grow popularity
Paper or ereaders (sustainablility and DRM),"So I have an ereader that I love but I‚Äôm somewhat unsure whether it makes more sense to buy paper or ebooks. 

When I had looked it up it seemed pretty clear that as long as you don‚Äôt just read like <20 book on your ereader that it‚Äôs more environmentally friendly. However, I don‚Äôt love the like actually-it‚Äôs-just-a-license-you-didn‚Äôt-actually-buy-the-book model that ereaders seem to have. I know methods for removing DRM exist but am /personally/ not ok removing it. 

To be clear, I read most books through Libby/Hoopla/the Library and some books through a kobo subscription, but when a book isn‚Äôt available by those means what‚Äôs the best course? I really lean towards ereader because when I‚Äôm reading in my second language it‚Äôs so much easier to look up a word and to keep reading whereas I have to get out my phone and can get distracted when reading paperback but again you aren‚Äôt really buying the book ? Idk ","library is the most sustainable imo.

and you are right you actually didn't buy the book. you just have the right to read it. vs if you buy it you can share it, resell it etc....

idk for you but my library if they don't have the book you want you can submit it and pretty soon they buy it.

also check second hand books that's an option too || From an environmental/ zero waste perspective if you already own the ebook reader then buying the ebook is easily the way to go. || There are a number of publishers that sell ebooks directly as files you download, so you do actually own the file and they can't pull it back for licensing reasons. The one I know off the top of my head is Verso but research smaller independent publishers in general.


https://www.versobooks.com/collections/verso-free-ebooks || You need to find out what the laws are in your local area. For exmaple in my area turns out you can just join any library in the state. I have like 5 library memberships and get a new one whenever I go on vacation or travel. I haven't bought a new book in years.

I do use the Kindle app to get free ebooks too. It's on my existing phone - so no extra devices. If you really want an eReader by one used on ebay.

And - you absolutely can buy most books second hand so there's no reason to buy those new either. || >However, I don‚Äôt love the like actually-it‚Äôs-just-a-license-you-didn‚Äôt-actually-buy-the-book model that ereaders seem to have

I understand not loving the idea, I don't either. But practically, is it making any real difference in your life? 

There are some publishers and individual authors from whom you can buy DRM-free ebooks. So that is worth exploring when there is a particular book that you want. 

But if you aren't willing to remove DRM or download a copy through other means, then I would consider whether or not the license model makes a meaningful difference in how you read books. Does having your own copy of an ebook file that you will probably never read again improve your life? Buying paper books is obviously the more wasteful choice if you already have an e-reader. || Used books are also an option, I hate e readers (hard on my eyes) so I prefer paper books.  If it's a book I want to keep and read multiple times or use as a reference book, I buy a used book. || DRM-free ebooks are actually very common. The majority of the ebooks I have are DRM-free. As for those that aren't, to be honest I don't see an issue with removing the DRM if the rights become unavailable in the future. I wouldn't be removing it to redistribute or profit off the content, just to continue viewing content that I paid to have access to. If the seller is no longer offering it, then they aren't losing anything when someone who already paid continues to use it. || Project Gutenberg hosts free ebooks. They're legal because they ""focus on older works for which U.S. copyright has expired"".

Also, from a technical perspective, if you download the ebook files from an online store onto a computer, you maintain control over them, so it doesn't really matter if you just have a ""license"" to read them IMO. Since the store can't mess with the files that you already downloaded. For the ereader itself, you can keep copies of older firmware on your computer if you want, so that if Kobo ever messes with the firmware in a way that you don't like (e.g. to disable reading some of your ebooks), you can simply reinstall an older version of the firmware. || Mostly, I get books via the library on my kindle. Occasionally I buy paper books, especially reference stuff, but very, very rarely an ebook. || There are plenty of ways you don‚Äôt have to buy an ebook. Libby for example, or Internet Archive. DRM is a valid concern but there are easy ways around it || You can buy ebooks from other places, and then side load those onto your kobo by simply connecting it to your computer and dragging and dropping the files on. This gets around the ebook owner being able to just change your book without telling you. Kobo E-readers can handle ADE DRM.


I would never suggest piracy, especially to someone such as yourself who doesn't like the idea of removing DRM. Having epubs with no DRM is simply terrible!

 and if I need something,  I will make a list now and just get exactly what I need. 

I walk as much as I can. To the grocery store and appointments,  wherever I need to go, i try to walk even if it takes me an hour in the winter when im freezing the whole time, I walk. And I feel healthier for it. 

I started doing some deep dives on all of the things that we consume that are toxic to us. Companies are pushing their products on us, making us believe we need them when, in reality, they are slowly killing us. So I stopped buying clothes that are made from anything but cotton or linen. I spend a lot of time looking up healthy alternatives to everyday products and am mindful about what I get. This way of living has me spending less on junk that is going into a landfill or ocean after a short amount of time. 
I have a small wardrobe, and im ok with that. 

I use cotton towels in the kitchen and a bidet and cotton cloths in the bathroom. 

I hang my clothes to dry. 

I stopped buying cleaning products just because they smell good and are pushed on us through ad after ad and just use basic things now. 

I don't use air conditioning. I know it's not a  choice for everyone, but I grew up poor and never had one, so I just don't use one.

It makes me feel defeated that no matter how much I try, it will not make a difference. But if everyone took the time to look into how bad the products are for us that big companies make and go the more eco-friendly route, it would make a huge difference.in the planet, in your health.  Stop supporting these companies. Live with less, and you may find out that you are happier that way. It helped my mental health when I downgraded everything in my life because that's less time I have to spend cleaning useless decorations and worrying about everything in the house being perfect. || Vegan

yeah zero waste, minimalism, efficiency also all help a bunch. || Vegan. 

Yes corporations are the primary contributors. But we fuel them with our dollars. They don't exist if we don't demand from them. Anyone who says they won't go vegan because it doesn't make a difference is personally fueling the death machine.

Am I doing enough? I think so. I don't have the means for electric car, and that's ok I guess. I get 40mpg. || Here's what I do to contribute on a personal level;

Net zero house 

Drive an EV

Reduced food waste to almost zero

Vote for progressive governments 

Try to buy from sustainable companies where possible 

Encourage others

Don't buy into fast tech (think like fast fashion but for gadgets that get thrown out quickly) or fast fashion for that matter

Reuse and repair items for as long as reasonably possible

Give away or sell still functioning items that we've out grown

Reduced waste from things like paper towel and other consumables

Maintaining equipment such as HVAC so it runs efficiently

It's not perfect, but it's my contribution. || Not eating red meat and not flying are probably the two biggest personal changes. Also, hook up with an environmental organization that has a ‚Äúclimate ambassador‚Äù or similar program, and follow their lead to make political change without reinventing the wheel. They‚Äôll send action alerts with simple instructions for who to call or write to, what to say, etc. || I think what stops me from doing more is simply that I'm focused on personally surviving. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs teaches that you have to have all your needs met (even complex ones like community and personal growth) to make powerful changes in your life. That's why social justice is an important piece of environmental activism.

But I still do what I can. If you check out Project Drawdown, two areas that have massive potential for cutting carbon emissions are reducing food waste and switching to a more plant-based diet. Two things that are pretty easy for the average person to do. Yeah, one person's actions might not make a huge difference, but not doing anything is like saying you don't vote because how can one vote make a difference?

I also recommend signing up for email newsletters from your local politicians. I'm a Democrat in a very red state, but I can still agree with some of the things my Republican representatives are doing. It makes it easier to reach out to them when you have the energy to do so and in the meantime, you at least know where they stand on various issues and you can vote accordingly each November (and really make sure you vote every year, not just congressional or presidential years). || I‚Äôm panicked about the rapid glacier melt. I recycle. I vote. || Try to borrow or buy things used. Eat less meat. Have conversations about the issues. Empower yourself in enjoyable, manageable ways to decouple from harmful systems. For example, I‚Äôm going to use this old bucket I found, seeds from the seed library, and soil I composted to try growing a few beans. One less thing to buy at the grocery store. With these kinds of projects, it‚Äôs a slow game and if it‚Äôs not manageable and enjoyable, you likely won‚Äôt end up making any meaningful or lasting progress. Vote for policies that support your agenda and support activists in ways that are available to you. Consider designing your life around it as you can. For example, I decided not to have kids because I knew I wouldn‚Äôt have time to be thoughtful about my consumption if I did. I‚Äôm not saying I think people should not have kids, but for me, I knew I‚Äôd be over extended and prioritize their immediate needs over my other values. I also moved to a walkable area and continued looking for job opportunities within a 5 minute walk of my house until I found one. Things like that add up a lot overtime. I don‚Äôt have to rigidly refuse to drive at all, but I‚Äôm not commuting 40 minutes a day‚Ä¶ || I am very concerned, yes, but no I do not struggle to find a way to help. I do what I can to buy less...no ""hauls"" and I reuse what I can (buy fabric backpacks and wash each year instead of buying new for each year of school).

But the biggest way I feel I contribute is by planting native plants.üå± I only started last year and have already noticed an increase in biodiversity in my yard. I may not be able to save the Earth but I sure can help my little piece of it! If everyone did this, imagine the impact. Even if all you can have is a planter on a balcony, you can still contribute. A great resource is Homegrown National Park. || Something small I've been doing is cutting up old t-shirts to use as stuffing for my sewing projects, most recently little pincushions. I haven't bought new stuffing in years - have been using scraps or old pillow innards.

It's small but it is one thing i can do pretty simply to stop myself from being overwhelmed. || I do my best, and when It Happens, my tools are sharp and ready || I try to garden and compost. im not....very successful ü§£but i try! 

Switching cat litter is probably one of the ways I've been most successful - I use a combo of wood pellets and shredded paper. They break down better than regular litter does, and it's a use for junk mail! || As there are many things contributing to climate issues one issue that I‚Äôm particularly passionate about is the increasing of plastic waste. I live in a beautiful wooded area that unfortunately is now full of various plastic waste that only i seem to be attempting to clean up and it has become so overwhelming. Same in town‚Ä¶ when doing cleanups it is beyond shocking how much plastic and styrofoam our roads and parks are littered with. You pick up a styrofoam cup and it literally crumbles into tiny pieces. And i thought styrofoam was banned here. 
I personally avoid single-use items and utensils as much as possible, avoid small convenient snacks packaged in mylar (and try to pack something from home), also try to encourage, educate, and inspire others to do the same. For years I‚Äôve been on and off very much discouraged hearing about little progress or local businesses here operating on a very wasteful level (and reintroducing styrofoam containers whereas i thought they are banned here). I‚Äôve been trying to talk to some local officials and environmental groups here about those concerns and surprisingly they do not share my same concern with the plastic crisis and therefore I‚Äôm struggling to get anyone to work with me on ideas and initiatives. In fact at our meetings they supplied plastic straws and utensils, and styrofoam cups! It is beyond frustrating and i only see it getting worse. I‚Äôm going to keep trying though.

To add to this, I lost my job back in June due to a mass layoff and I started studying up on what‚Äôs involved with being a zero-waste consultant. I‚Äôm wondering though what companies actually invest in that and employees to help monitor and ensure their sustainability as a business, so there‚Äôs much i am still learning about that. But I would love to help businesses become more circular (with what we have. Ultimately yes the major manufacturers need to change their materials!) || Yes, I think about the impact of humans on the climate every day. I'm sometimes actively depressed about it.

I don't necessarily find it difficult to do simple things to help, but the true despair is knowing that the things I do aren't making a whole lot of difference. Still, I try really hard.

I limit what I buy, and hardly ever buy anything new. Almost everything I buy is second-hand, and if not second-hand, then I try to buy from a local business. 

I try to repair things rather than throwing them away and buying new.

I compost. 

Whenever possible, I grow my own food (no fertilizers or pesticides), and/or buy food from local farmers and grocers.

I reuse almost every plastic bag that comes into our house. We have dogs and I almost never have to buy poop bags.

I try to consolidate car trips and I drive a car that gets very good gas mileage. Someday when my car dies, I plan to get an EV, but can't afford it right now.

Containers for packing Lunch,"My tupperware all are random plastic containers my college roommates and I acquired. Some ‚Äúnice‚Äù rubbermaid ones, and a bunch of cheap ikea/other random brand containers. I have probably four different brands. Storage drives me crazy. I need to find a way to stack four brands of tupperware, many of which have multiple sizes. I need to make my containers uniform (one brand in a few sizes). This is where I need your help deciding on the best option (note, anything I get rid of will go to my local buy nothing group):

1) Get rid of everything and start fresh with glass tupperware. I like this because as my frontal lobe develops microplastics are becoming increasingly concerning for me LOL. But this means replacing my entire collection $$$

2) Get rid of everything but the rubbermaid tupperware, grab a few more to supplement my needs. This means the least amount of items that I need to rehome (chance of things ending up in the landfills)

3) Suck it up and deal with the mismatched tupperware. It‚Äôs not that deep. 

Also open to any other thoughts people have here. Thanks!","I have been replacing my old plastic ones with new glass and silicone ones as they become too damaged to use (yes sometimes this takes years). If you are concerned about the plastic you could relegate the old ones to things that don‚Äôt involve heat like snacks, or storage in other areas of your home like office supplies or tools.¬† || Suck it up and deal with mismatched Tupperware.  It‚Äôs always better and less waste to use what you already have. || I got all my glass storage containers from thrift stores and By Nothing Groups. I try to stick to brands that sell their lids separately online since that‚Äôs what tends to break.¬†

I use the plastic ones I owned for non food items like paint.¬† || I‚Äôm in the plastic free sub, so my take doesn‚Äôt really match with zero waste, but I replaced all of my containers with either stainless steel ones or most are the Pyrex ultimate dishes, which have glass lids with silicone to seal. I see it as these dishes, as long as I don‚Äôt break them, should last me basically forever. Sometimes I have a bad habit of leaving a dish closed up and it gets moldy, and with plastic Tupperware, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable using it again, but glass doesn‚Äôt have that issue. And doesn‚Äôt stain obviously. I didn‚Äôt have much plastic Tupperware to begin with though, but I gave what I had to family that I know don‚Äôt care about plastic || Pretty much all of my food storage is in mason jars I got from local buy nothing groups or found on great deal at a thrift store I really like. Things that can‚Äôt go in those, like sandwiches, go in ziplock brand silicone bags and a single Stasher bag I found in another thrift store. || I just replaced all my random containers with a single set of glass ones and honestly it‚Äôs been worth every penny. The stacking is so much easier and I don‚Äôt stress about plastics or microwaving. || Get the glass ones and use the plastic ones you already have for storing non-food items. I'm also really concerned about microplastics, and while I know I won't be able to eliminate them entirely, I do try really hard to reduce my exposure. If you're wanting to find a lower waste way to go, see what you can find in thrift stores. || Tiffin carrier type of thing should last forever

Look at this product I found on google.com https://share.google/7k0cH97pvCMfAcGBB || You can use spaghetti sauce jars, peanut butter jars, jelly jars, sauce jars, etc too store food in also. If you're using them already, it's pretty easy to scrape off the label and use them like you would Tupperware. || We bought a nice set of glass containers for food storage, especially for things like leftovers that need to be reheated. Being able to pre-portion leftovers for lunches in glass is amazing because they can be heated up easily. These are nicely stacked in our cabinets which makes everything so much easier. 

When I make baked goods to give away, I give them away in the older plastic containers we don‚Äôt care about so I don‚Äôt have to worry about getting the container back. They can either give it back and we will use it again for this purpose or they can keep it. We also use the older plastic containers to bring snacks on trips, that way we don‚Äôt have to worry about them getting lost or damaged. We leave the lids on when storing so we know where the match is and put them on our basement pantry shelf so they don‚Äôt take up premium kitchen space. || The most sustainable things you can get is non and use the ones you have. That being said: I find it nice to have matching food containers and other kitchen items! For me especially having multiple of the same size, so the lids can be used interchangeably. And it being stackable.

Take some time to evaluate your needs and wants. See what sizes you use the most, maybe get multiples or nice versions of these. If you see yourself having a favourite container, think why and get more of the same or with the same properties. Do you even need multiple? You might only need one lunch box. Get rid of the ones that no one has used in a year.

I have put very specific food containers on my Christmas Wishlist before, and thought they were a great gift when I got them. ¬†Of course you can treat yourself, ‚ÄúThis is the Pyrex set I got from my first wage‚Äù

My opinion on materials: If I regularly shop in the grocery store, get plastic packaged food and wear plastic sports clothing I will not trash my plastic food containers. I have gotten into the habit of not microwaving food in the plastic though.

I love my glass containers (Pyrex Cook and Go) for everyday use, meal prep and reheating. I have taken soups with me to work in them, no spills! I love my large opening jars I safe for storing leftovers. Like one portion of veggies or overnight oats. I love the ten identical 0.5 Liter plastic ‚ÄúTupperware‚Äù I have for the same purpose. They are easier to deal with than the jars, especially for freezing. And they fit a whole bread roll. I love my stainless-steel lunchbox for non-reheated lunch on the go. It‚Äôs large, light (compared to glass) and durable. || I have both plastic and glass containers. I got the plastic one when I was in school more than 10 years ago. I only use the plastic one for cold stuff like storing hard boiled egg, half an onion, dried goods. Not ideal, but I‚Äôm fine with it. 

Try the 1 out 1 in strategy. You don‚Äôt need to buy glass containers all at once. Just retire the old ones, then get one glass container at a time. You know, the ones that cracked, melted by high heat, ruined by the dishwasher. || Metal lunchboxes || Please, don‚Äôt use plastic containers for food. Swap it with glass. It‚Äôs a bit of an upfront investment, but if you cook often and plan to keep them long term, glass is awesome. The reason you want to stay away from plastic is that microplastic and other chemicals are leaching in when you heat things up in plastic containers.",12,ZeroWaste,2025-08-26 03:15:24,containers packing lunch,tupperware random plastic containers college roommates acquired nice rubbermaid ones bunch cheap ikea random brand containers probably four different brands storage drives crazy need find way stack four brands tupperware many multiple sizes need make containers uniform one brand sizes need help deciding best option note anything get rid go local buy nothing group get rid everything start fresh glass tupperware like frontal lobe develops microplastics becoming increasingly concerning lol means replacing entire collection get rid everything rubbermaid tupperware grab supplement needs means least amount items need rehome chance things ending landfills suck deal mismatched tupperware deep also open thoughts people thanks,replacing old plastic ones new glass silicone ones become damaged use yes sometimes takes years concerned plastic could relegate old ones things involve heat like snacks storage areas home like office supplies tools suck deal mismatched tupperware always better less waste use already got glass storage containers thrift stores nothing groups try stick brands sell lids separately online since tends break use plastic ones owned non food items like paint plastic free sub take really match zero waste replaced containers either stainless steel ones pyrex ultimate dishes glass lids silicone seal see dishes long break last basically forever sometimes bad habit leaving dish closed gets moldy plastic tupperware feel comfortable using glass issue stain obviously much plastic tupperware begin though gave family know care plastic pretty much food storage mason jars got local buy nothing groups found great deal thrift store really like things go like sandwiches go ziplock brand silicone bags single stasher bag found another thrift store replaced random containers single set glass ones honestly worth every penny stacking much easier stress plastics microwaving get glass ones use plastic ones already storing non food items also really concerned microplastics know able eliminate entirely try really hard reduce exposure wanting find lower waste way go see find thrift stores tiffin carrier type thing last forever look product found google com use spaghetti sauce jars peanut butter jars jelly jars sauce jars etc store food also using already pretty easy scrape label use like would tupperware bought nice set glass containers food storage especially things like leftovers need reheated able pre portion leftovers lunches glass amazing heated easily nicely stacked cabinets makes everything much easier make baked goods give away give away older plastic containers care worry getting container back either give back use purpose keep also use older plastic containers bring snacks trips way worry getting lost damaged leave lids storing know match put basement pantry shelf take premium kitchen space sustainable things get non use ones said find nice matching food containers kitchen items especially multiple size lids used interchangeably stackable take time evaluate needs wants see sizes use maybe get multiples nice versions see favourite container think get properties even need multiple might need one lunch box get rid ones one used year put specific food containers christmas wishlist thought great gift got course treat pyrex set got first wage opinion materials regularly shop grocery store get plastic packaged food wear plastic sports clothing trash plastic food containers gotten habit microwaving food plastic though love glass containers pyrex cook go everyday use meal prep reheating taken soups work spills love large opening jars safe storing leftovers like one portion veggies overnight oats love ten identical liter plastic tupperware purpose easier deal jars especially freezing fit whole bread roll love stainless steel lunchbox non reheated lunch go large light compared glass durable plastic glass containers got plastic one school years ago use plastic one cold stuff like storing hard boiled egg half onion dried goods ideal fine try strategy need buy glass containers retire old ones get one glass container time know ones cracked melted high heat ruined dishwasher metal lunchboxes please use plastic containers food swap glass bit upfront investment cook often plan keep long term glass awesome reason want stay away plastic microplastic chemicals leaching heat things plastic containers
"When they say corporations have tricked consumers into thinking it is the consumer's duty to do the recycling, what would things look like if this was corrected?","I've heard it said that most waste/pollution happens with the manufacturing of our goods and that companies do a poor job of reducing pollution/waste but instead have done propaganda where they encourage consumers to recycle and clean up the environment. How would the world be different if businesses actually fixed their problems? Would it mean that there would be significantly less plastic in products and packaging at stores? Would beverages be sold in glass containers? Or would things look pretty similar to today for the consumer and all the improvements would be invisible as they would be done at the manufacturer and the only sign would be less waste going to the landfill?

A source: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1BfPw7lnQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1BfPw7lnQ)","If regulations forced corporations to be environmentally responsible, we would see such innovation. Imagine if they spent their billions on sustainable research and initiatives instead of more marketing? A r/solarpunk world - this is the kind of activism and lobbying we need! || Reducing plastics and switching to glass wouldn't be enough to significantly impact the amount of waste multiple industries are producing as a whole. For one thing, industries are more likely to find a replacement ""plastic-not-plastic"" cousin to use like they did with BPA. Glass seems like a natural transition but we're currently dealing with a world wide sand shortage, combine that with the huge amount of resources it takes to recycle glass and you learn pretty quickly that it's not really a viable option long term. We could get companies to switch to aluminum when ever possible and encourage people to use return services on products. Aluminum is by far one of the most recyclable materials we have, it's sturdy and can withstand rough shipping more reliably than glass. Return services would be a huge job creator because it would require mailing services, cleaning services for the returning bottles, etc. There are already some companies that are doing this kind of thing right now, but I think you'd be hard pressed to make it a massive trend without legislation requiring it. There's also the problem that completely abandoning plastics in general is effectively pretty ablelist. Many products are specifically made with plastic because of it's flexibility which makes a product more accessible to elderly individuals and people with medical problems that make using firmer materials effectively impossible. So it's important that when we consider alternatives we also take into account that there are individuals who will need a product with equal effectiveness to the current plastic model.   
  
More important than packaging, how we manufacture products would have to change significantly. There's an unfortunately troubling trend of making products non-repairable in order to increase buying - this is a major problem with mobile phones, electronics, and I've noticed similar trends popping up in car manufacturing as well. Taking away a consumers right to repair is a massive cause for waste that could be fixed right now, and not only would it reduce waste but it would also recreate jobs we used to have in localized repair shops for a number of product types.   
  
When it comes to electronics in general, we need to start making requirements to improve the longitivity of these devices - it's pretty insane that you almost have to update all of your electronics every three years because they'll stop updates to force you to buy the latest product. And sure, you could, as a consumer, choose not to update your devices but unfortunately we're knee deep in the information era where not using a device that is getting consistent updates puts your digital footprint in significant security risk. More importantly than that, we do not have the resources to keep up this level of consumerism that these manufacturing practices force on us, the minerals needed to make the batteries of mobile phones alone are incredibly rare, and harvesting them not just environmentally damaging but it's usually done with extremely exploitative practices. I don't know that we could ever completely eliminate the need for these minerals but if we created batteries and screens to be as long lived as possible and made products upgradable as well as repairable, we'd certainly reduce the amount of waste produced by manufacturing these products to begin with. || Just to add to your thesis in the first part of your paragraph, it's also a matter of how companies have been regulated, mostly not, that has caused the consumer to be responsible for recycling. The propaganda, as you call it, is a result of that lack of regulation, imho, more than who has become ultimately responsible (which I think is all of us). || There is no way of effectively dealing with this problem that will not also be a ‚Äúburden‚Äù on the consumer in one way or another; whether it‚Äôs increased cost, decreased convenience, reduced food and product shelf life, reduced or eliminated availability of products, etc. As long as we live in a free market economy and society that prioritizes GDP, consumer choice and individual liberties, there is no way to effectively deal with it. Simple, low-hanging-fruit regulations, like banning single use plastic bags or straws, still gets people bitching about the individual consumer being burdened. Now imagine banning all plastic, or even just single use plastic, except for medical use.

Why, in that video do they briefly touch on the issue of a sustainable alternative becoming unsustainable at scale and then just drop it and go no further?

People need to get over the fantasy of some ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù magic wand that makes everything sustainable without any noticeable changes to their own daily lives.

Three sided toothbrush,Do any more sustainable options exist? I can only find plastic ones on the market and nothing else.

Why isn't there recycled cotton bedding yet?,"I‚Äôve been researching sustainable bedding, and it seems like the main options are either¬†organic cotton¬†or¬†bamboo/lyocell. Organic is definitely a step up from conventional cotton, but it still takes a lot of land, water, and energy to grow from scratch.

What I almost never see are¬†sheets or duvet covers made with recycled cotton. Recycled fibers have come a long way, and many apparel brands have adopted it, but bedding seems left behind.

Is this because of quality issues? Or just that brands haven‚Äôt picked it up yet?

And on a side note, would people here actually be interested in¬†recycled cotton, or recycled‚Äìorganic cotton blends¬†for bedding if they existed?","Recycled cotton will never be as durable as new cotton. ¬†It has to be blended back in with other fibers to add strength. ¬†As a fiber artist, this makes sense to me. Shredding down the fibers and respiring them won't be very strong.¬†

¬†¬†Polyester is easier to find because its not made from recycled fabrics. Instead its made from recycled plastics like water bottles. That means they are making the fibers from scratch.¬†

I went with sheets from American blossom. 100% organic cotton manufactured and grown in the US. They are thick and should last a long long time. After three years they have gotten softer, but no thin spots.¬† || I should imagine that recycled fabrics are going to have some issues (by and large) with shortening of fibres due to processing.


Bedding actually takes a surprising beating (especially the sheets you sleep on top of) and shorter fibres will wear out quicker. I can't imagine a consumer being happy paying the slight premium that recycled, cotton bedding would have over new poly cotton but not getting the longevity that you want out of bedsheets. They're not like clothes in that our consumer behaviour with them is still mostly ""buy once and use until holey"".


This is me talking almost entirely out of my arse, however, so take what I say with a significant pinch of salt. || I work for a home wares store and they sell some 100% recycled cotton bedding but not a lot. The sheets and pillowcases range is larger than the duvets and all are plain colours with no pattern.

They don't feel as nice as the regular cotton, although they don't feel any worse than a polycotton.

While its not strictly greenwashing the product just does feel a bit like a checkbox for the company to pretend they're being eco friendly while the biggest problem is the pure volume of products being produced. || There are a few, [check this one out.](https://www.almagreendesign.com/about) || Literally Ikea (Germany) has some made with 30% recycled Cotton. [https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/aengslilja-bettwaesche-set-2-teilig-weiss-00608908/](https://www.ikea.com/de/de/p/aengslilja-bettwaesche-set-2-teilig-weiss-00608908/) Another set is made from 15% recycled Cotton, and a different set is made from organic cotton. So, the option at Ikea for 100% cotton seems to be either some part recycling some part conventional cotton, 100% new organic cotton or 100% new conventional cotton. 

Recycled - organic blend sounds like the best option for cotton for me. Longevity, sustainable growing and less resource use through recycling. But maybe that way you can‚Äôt label your whole product organic, thus lose a marketing term.

But: I am really happy that I don‚Äôt need to look into bedding and the sustainability aspects right now!

I mean a thrift shop (or grandmas closet) set of bedding would beat anything made new, in terms of sustainability. But then I actually use bedding until it becomes threadbare and rips. And I dislike shopping for it. I have seen a fair trade import shop in town carrying nice looking bedding. Or rather use Ikea since it‚Äôs cheaper? 100% cotton or do I like the lyocell feeling much more? What does my partner think? Way too much to consider! || What about [hemp](https://jodope.com/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=20337877823&gbraid=0AAAAAoNLc5yfSvn6yXJr4PCG0VNYnLHbL&gclid=Cj0KCQjwh5vFBhCyARIsAHBx2wx4siqagZjXncGiiTcC3BggACfOlOND5FMIT7Jguc8NNXbF1QpFXnIaAufZEALw_wcB)? || Parachute sells used bedding that are probably mostly from open box returns.

It's also not ""healthier"" than conventional practices. It just preys on people's health fears.

Trying to live sustainably‚Ä¶ but sometimes I‚Äôm just tired.,"I try hard to live sustainably. I use toothpaste tablets, and I‚Äôve switched to solid shampoo bars. My teeth and hair have never been better, so I do feel like it‚Äôs worth it.

But sometimes I just get tired. Like, I wash out yogurt containers before recycling them (even when I really don‚Äôt feel like it),   
Is this even doing anything?  
Like, I‚Äôm one person. Does it really matter?

I know I‚Äôll keep going, but today I just need a little boost.","It's a strange feeling rinsing yogurt containers while you see a billionare hop on their private jet and make more emissions in one day than you will in your lifetime. I think instead of looking at it as ""other people are doing way worse, what's the point?"" you have to think more in terms of your own morals/values. Sure, maybe in the grand scheme of things, the waste that I'm not producing isn't making a dent when so many others are creating garbage at an alarming rate. However, it is my responsibility as a steward of this earth to do as little damage as possible while I'm here. Every piece of plastic recycled, every zero-waste option chosen is my little form of resistance, my way of making an empowered choice and having control over something. That one yogurt container may not mean much, but over your lifetime, all of the time spent recycling and finding zero waste alternatives will be your legacy, and you can feel proud knowing you did whatever you could to mitigate damage while you were here. || Just remember we're all trying to be better. None of us are perfect.  

Even if you throw out the yogurt container instead of washing and recycling sometimes. It's still better to recycle 70% of the time instead of none. || Don't be too hard on yourself. Living sustainably in our society means working against the way our economic system is set up - and that can be very exhausting sometimes. But I believe that even small, imperfect contributions matter. Change starts small! You don't know how many people you might have inspired already. || [removed] || I‚Äôm not even remotely zero waste, but look at this journey as *reducing* harm. My goal is to avoid overconsumption and buy from businesses that align with my ethics as much as possible. I know for a fact that I can‚Äôt do it all and will be miserable if I try. I‚Äôm plant based 95% of the time, but vegetarian 5% of the time when traveling and/or eating with friends and the vegan option is miserable. I buy plastic packaging, but use a solid dish soap and luffah sponge. I can‚Äôt speak for others, but the reason I can make peace with it is because the alternative is either doing nothing at all or living a miserable life. I know zero wasters who wouldn‚Äôt eat fruit because it came in plastic, but the billionaires fly jets everywhere. Align your choices with your values, but also have grace for yourself. Your choices are just a drop in the bucket - but is that something that fills up *your* bucket? || New neighbours have moved in. I live in a flat in London so we ""share"" bins. One for trash, one for recycling (dry mixed) and one for food waste.

My God, these fuckers *cannot* managetheir rubbish. So my diligently washed out yoghurt pots and the like get jumbled up with their scuzzy tissues, while the trash bin is fill with recyclable plastic water bottles, dozens and dozens of them! They are so stupid they think you can put half empty cans - yes cans - in the food bin. I have written multiple unfailingly polite (read - British for fuck you)  notes explaining how steel and tin are not compostable.

ANYWAY my point is this: there will always be people who make fuck all effort with even basic things. Who drink bottle after bottle of water despite tap water being perfectly acceptable. Who mindlessly throw things away or ask for a plastic bag for something they could perfectly easily carry *in their hands*.
Equally there will always (well hopefully not always) people who thoughtlessly hop on private jets without a care in the world.

I like to channel my (IMO, at least) righteous rage by angrily putting on marigolds and sorting my neighbours' rubbish into the correct bins, while calling them dickheads loudly enough for them to hear. Yelling ""c*nt"" when I see someone drop litter from a car gives me a similar boost. (Yes I have a terrible potty mouth) :)

Keep going, keep going! || My analogy is the person walking the beach that throws the starfishes back in. The stranger says you‚Äôre not gonna make a difference. The person picks up another starfish and throws it back in and says I made a difference for that starfish. 

I think it does matter, but even if every every every every every human does everything in their possibility, we‚Äôre not gonna touch it. It is a negative perspective but it‚Äôs also realistic. I like how it‚Äôs made type of shows watch anything with plastic. It‚Äôs all with water. The big giant corporations the manufacturing is the majority. However, I do believe that we can make a difference I was raised with reduce reuse recycle. || Hey first of all, saving the entire planet is not just on your shoulders, and furthermore, cannot be saved by your actions alone. Do what you can do, and don't put so much pressure on yourself. Take a break, have a luxury item, throw something in the actual trash if you need to today. I have been trying for 30 years. I think I have made an impact, but it takes massive commercial/industrial and policy changes to turn this ship around. Do what you can to influence and support that. If you're burned out, take a break. Saving the planet is hard. I see you. || It's true that we're never going to individual-action our way out of systemic problems. But, as other people have said, every little bit helps. On the other hand, there's a limit on how much a little bit will help, by definition. We need systemic change, which means political change, and reducing waste may seem irrelevant to our real problems.

But it's not. Zero waste *does* help with our political problems indirectly, an effect that I think can have far more impact than its direct effect on the waste stream.

An example: I moved some years ago, and over the preceding months I picked up all the cardboard boxes I needed from the street. It was a mild pain in my ass to do, but I saved a little money and prevented a little waste. From that perspective it was worth it, but it's not like I felt that strongly one way or another--I could also have not done it.

But then I learned that Uline, the cardboard-box monopoly (because we have not just Big Oil and Big Tech but also Big Cardboard), is a major funder of right-wing causes and politicians. So I wasn't just keeping some cardboard out of the waste stream for another use, I was keeping money out of Uline's pockets.

Which kept their profits lower. 

Which left them less money to fund the sort of politicians who perpetuate and worsen the mess we're in.

When I learned that, I felt freaking *great* about not buying those cardboard boxes. It's companies like Uline that got us into this mess in the first place, and *fuck them.*

So when you use toothpaste tablets, you're not just keeping the tube out of a landfill. You're hurting Colgate-Palmolive, and you're hurting the sort of politician who kowtows to Colgate-Palmolive, who is exactly the sort of politician we need less of.

When you don't buy something from Amazon, even though it's something you kind of actually did want, you're not just saving that amount of resources. You're cutting into Amazon's profits, which cuts into all of the shitty things Amazon money funds.*

And so on and so on and so on.

And a little goes a long way here--the way big companies work, a small drop in sales can have a disproportionately large effect on profits.

So when you look at the effects of what you do, you have to remember the indirect effects--they may be a lot more than you're aware of.

*There's also a knock-on effect on waste here--less money for Amazon means less for Bezos, for Wall Street, for big investors, and so on, and almost all of their spending is waste. So Bezos has a bit less cash for that next fucking yacht. || It's principles.  Most things we do we would do with no one else in the world because it's just what we feel we should do.  For example, I do everything I can to avoid products from China.  People tell me all the time that I am wasting my time because everything is from there and I am just a drop in the ocean.  Still I feel good about it and I do it anyway :) || It matters. Life is always happening to us in the capitalist, consumerist, attention theft economy. It gets overwhelming, but it matters. You're not just one person, you're one of millions. 

I've been doing ecology field work, greening/city depaving, waste diversion, invasive species control, and tending to native species in my area for a few years. We recently rehabbed our waterways enough that Spatterdock could start thriving again. 

Two days ago I was sitting outside and a Spatterdock darner flew up to me and landed on my phone. We have monarch butterflies for the first time in many years in any abundance. I've seen many fireflies this year. The signs that it matters are everywhere, even when the crises are loudly in our faces too. Without many ""just one person"" people, I may have never seen such a thing in my lifetime. 

My family's entire hometown is on fire right now, but hopefully the fire is becoming manageable after months of it growing. The town is abundant in blueberries. Hopefully 2027 is a year rich in berries, while we keep on doing the small things as a collective. || I agree with all but I have a question : Why washing yoghurts ? It's not done by recycling ? If it's done 2 times, it's a waste of water, no ? || I know the yogurt container was one specific example but we just leave the recyclable container with the dishes and just do it all at once. We usually just put them in the dishwasher when we run a load then recycle them from there. 

The dishwasher was going to run anyways and dishwasher uses less water in general so we‚Äôre not running extra water to rinse the container by itself. It also makes the dishwasher more full, further reducing the impact of the dishwasher. Occasionally the container will warp but who cares, it‚Äôs getting recycled anyways. || I know how you feel, it's easy to feel like just a drop in the ocean. There was a great quote in a movie called Cloud Atlas-""what is an ocean, but a multitude of drops"". Maybe someone will notice something you are doing and think, ""I should do this"". In my own life, -I saw someone in a store using a resuseable mesh bag to put her produce in one day, and that teensy light clicked-now I use them too. It started a whole chain of adjustments in my life- to using glass for storage instead of plastic-a water filter instead of single use bottles, and I'm still evolving.

I'm charging my devices with this solar panel . It produces around 6Wh daily if it's sunny and if the sun shines directly at it . I know it's pointless but knowing each 1000 Wh produces  220g of CO2 I'm doing my part  in trying to not waste electricity .  So it does matter that you do your part ,  you shouldn't look at what others do or how much  they waste , comparation is the thief of joy || Your behavior is contagious.

That‚Äôs reason alone for me to keep going (in my imperfect way) and to continue talking about it. || I don't have much to offer, but: at some point, you might not even know what to do with that yogurt container other than to rinse and recycle it. I've been at it so long that throwing a slimy, unclean yogurt container in my trash would gnaw at my psyche so much that it'd be way worse than the 30 seconds it takes to rinse it. It all just becomes second nature.  
  
But also, if you need a break from anything, there's no reason not to take that break. You are way more important than any one piece of trash--or even a whole week's worth of trash! Everyone needs a break sometimes from things that feel difficult! || I‚Äôve hit a wall with a lot of health and beauty empties. I dread the water waste to clean a lot of them if only to clean them but fear they might still not get recycled. Tossing them altogether feels terrible though so there they sit. || Sometimes I get depressed and want to say fck it all. Why do these things if no one else is?

Motivation for eco brick,"Hi guys, for a while now I‚Äôve been putting all of my non-compostable and non-recyclable trash into eco bricks. I just finished filling a second one and am feeling like it‚Äôs useless. Ideas for what to do with them? Does it even make a difference? ","Personally I think eco bricks are bullsh*t, they are just delaying plastic waste entering the environment later and are yet another way consumers not producers are shouldering the burden of excessive plastic production. And your dilemma of what to do with an eco brick illustrates their utter uselessness. Jmo though || When I first came across the idea I was into it. But as I did more research, I realized that they really aren‚Äôt the best tool to build something. They aren‚Äôt very structurally stable and would deteriorate due to sun/UV. Eventually the microplastics will leak into soil/ocean. There also aren‚Äôt any local organizations near me who take them and I don‚Äôt think mailing more plastics to poorer countries is the answer. 

Occasionally I make a version of one using something I‚Äôd already be throwing out (like a paper cup with lid  for example), but I‚Äôm using them more as a mini trash can that consolidates my non-recyclable waste. Then I toss it in trash when it‚Äôs full. It saves space in my trash can so it‚Äôs filling up less, but that‚Äôs about it. You‚Äôd have a much better impact trying to reduce plastic waste when possible. || The container at least contains smaller pieces of plastic to avoid it blowing away. Harder to accidentally eat a large protein power container than eating a bottle cap thinking it's food. Plus, it'll delay the time for the small bits to decompose if they're within another container. || If you personally can use eco bricks in some manner, I think they make sense. To make them in expectation that someone else can close the consumption cycle feels a little weird. 

I was excited about ecobricks, until I looked at some of the projects that used them, and most seemed non local. || The one good thing I see about making eco bricks is that it corrals plastic waste into one solid product. A lot of ‚Äúlitter‚Äù comes from overflowing garbage cans, trash bags that have ripped open or if wind catches something when going from trash can to truck to landfill. The eco brick makes it all one tightly packed piece that makes it easier to handle throughout the entire chain || The best thing we can do as consumers is to not generate the plastic bottle garbage or the garbage that gets stuffed in to it.   This is just nonsense unless it is really the only thing or the thing that there is  the most of to do what needs to be done.  

This is just green washing and giving a people a false sense of the harsh reality.

And it does often prevent the garbage from having any chance of being recycled.    But even recycling has a huge price to it and is questionable.

The same thing where people take plastic bags and cut it into ""plarn"" and crochet so called ""sleeping mats"" for homeless.   It just gets trashed instead of having any hope of being recycled.   But who knows how much of that gets recycled, anyway?

The very best thing we can do is to NOT buy so many things.  So much of what is in those bottles and what was in the garbage that is getting stuffed in there, are really things that are not a necessary to full and clean life, at all.   

We dont have enough needs to repurpose all the excess stuff.    Most of what it gets used for just gets trashed down the road because it is useless and undesirable. 

What we need is to stop generating the trash. || i used the ones i was able to make to build a small fruit wall. i enclosed them in glass bottles though then used plaster around that.¬†


i built the little fruit wall/corner to plant a fig tree in so it would have its own warm spot.¬†


i started out trying to do them in milk jugs but then realized glass might contain it for longer. structurally it's the plaster holding that wall, and some t-posts, i used a little burlap in it. but the ecobricks take up space in it and that was what i needed them for. || I make these kinda with my trash from when I use my breast pump and need nursing pads. They have so much stuff on them that I always end up tossing them all over the place but I've been putting all the trash into empty bottles that I drink during pumping sessions. It takes up so little space in my trashcans compared to before. || Thank you zoot‚Ä¶ for bringing this topic forward!  I‚Äôd never heard of eco bricks before so I googled it and found instructions. Thanks! I‚Äôm going to start making one right away and talking about it with my family and friends. 

I like the idea of compacting non-recyclables into a bottle; just that much less loose stuff flying around interfering with the environment. It‚Äôs also a good project that kids can do, and with the added bonus of them developing an awareness of the types of trash in their lives. 

It‚Äôs a great classroom project too that opens the door to all kinds of discussions about recycling vs landfill trash and everyone‚Äôs place in that cycle. And, even though we choose to avoid toxic plastic in our food and lives as much as possible, it‚Äôs still being generated in ever-increasing quantities. 

Eco bricks is kinda like the ‚Äúcapture and kill‚Äù tactic of newspapers & media, it keeps some of the truthy-bits from spreading uncontrollably. lol!",10,ZeroWaste,2025-08-19 08:06:28,motivation eco brick,hi guys putting non compostable non recyclable trash eco bricks finished filling second one feeling like useless ideas even make difference,personally think eco bricks bullsh delaying plastic waste entering environment later yet another way consumers producers shouldering burden excessive plastic production dilemma eco brick illustrates utter uselessness jmo though first came across idea research realized really best tool build something structurally stable would deteriorate due sun uv eventually microplastics leak soil ocean also local organizations near take think mailing plastics poorer countries answer occasionally make version one using something already throwing like paper cup lid example using mini trash consolidates non recyclable waste toss trash full saves space trash filling less much better impact trying reduce plastic waste possible container least contains smaller pieces plastic avoid blowing away harder accidentally eat large protein power container eating bottle cap thinking food plus delay time small bits decompose within another container personally use eco bricks manner think make sense make expectation someone else close consumption cycle feels little weird excited ecobricks looked projects used seemed non local one good thing see making eco bricks corrals plastic waste one solid product lot litter comes overflowing garbage cans trash bags ripped open wind catches something going trash truck landfill eco brick makes one tightly packed piece makes easier handle throughout entire chain best thing consumers generate plastic bottle garbage garbage gets stuffed nonsense unless really thing thing needs done green washing giving people false sense harsh reality often prevent garbage chance recycled even recycling huge price questionable thing people take plastic bags cut plarn crochet called sleeping mats homeless gets trashed instead hope recycled knows much gets recycled anyway best thing buy many things much bottles garbage getting stuffed really things necessary full clean life dont enough needs repurpose excess stuff gets used gets trashed road useless undesirable need stop generating trash used ones able make build small fruit wall enclosed glass bottles though used plaster around built little fruit wall corner plant fig tree would warm spot started trying milk jugs realized glass might contain longer structurally plaster holding wall posts used little burlap ecobricks take space needed make kinda trash use breast pump need nursing pads much stuff always end tossing place putting trash empty bottles drink pumping sessions takes little space trashcans compared thank zoot bringing topic forward never heard eco bricks googled found instructions thanks going start making one right away talking family friends like idea compacting non recyclables bottle much less loose stuff flying around interfering environment also good project kids added bonus developing awareness types trash lives great classroom project opens door kinds discussions recycling vs landfill trash everyone place cycle even though choose avoid toxic plastic food lives much possible still generated ever increasing quantities eco bricks kinda like capture kill tactic newspapers media keeps truthy bits spreading uncontrollably lol
How to make water tasty?,"When I'm out and about, I'm usually carrying my water bottle(s) with me. Sometimes the pure taste of water is not enough though, and I would prefer to put something in. Preferably while on the go, so tea doesn't work without a hot water supply. Best would be some kind of powder, so I also don't need any filter.
Anybody got any ideas?","my go to is lemon or lime.

but you can also put a couple of berries or cucumber in water.

then you have a small amount of juice .

crushed mint also works.

for tea no need for hot let it infuse in cold water overnight in the fridge ... not too much just like maybe the equivalent of a bag for a big bottle (1 liter) ... if it's not too strong you get the taste without wanting to add sugar. I usually use flavoured tea so not sure how it goes for plain tea. also in cold water it's less bitter. same goes for mate, roibos, infusions....

edit: I tried kikucha tea it's very different since roasted but it's very refreshing too. || A mint tea bag does wonders, even if you add it to cold water, especially if you leave it in for longer || If a wide mouthed, insulated water bottle, try some cucumber and lemon slices. I‚Äôd load up with ice at the start of the day.¬†

It won‚Äôt be as flavorful by the end of the day.

You can decide if it‚Äôs kinda suspect to have lukewarm fruit water at the end of a day.¬†

Apples, cucumbers, basil, oranges, even celery. ‚ÄúSpa water‚Äù is a google term for you.¬† || True Lemon crystalized lemon, but they've since branched out to other fruits. IIRC both the packaging and packets came in recyclable cardboard/paper packaging. || \- Salt

\- Beverage concentrate

\- Electrolyte powder that have some flavor in it || https://preview.redd.it/xh6p7zxlaujf1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7886b826878170e5fe5bde0e433adfeb3bfb4f6

I bought these, and use a small dropper bottle to carry them with me

Edit: glass bottles || I add trace minerals to my water and it completely changes it for me. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúflavored‚Äù, and helps with hydration. 10/10 recommend. || Star anise. Drop one (or even part of one) into a bottle of water. It infuses the water with a subtle flavor. I like to start the bottle off the night before to give it time to infuse, and top up the water when I've drank half of it. This way refills still have flavor, just weaker and it continues to infuses all day. I keep a bottle going 2-3 days and toss into the compost bin when I give the bottle a scrub and reset. If you try to buy them at the bottles spice section of the grocery store they are ridiculously expensive, But if you find an Asian or Hispanic market, you can probably get a little bag with a dozen or so of them for a $1.99 || Sun tea is an option if you have a UV light from either growing herbs or having lizards. Place your water with the herbs by the light and it takes around 4-6 hours. || You can do lemon juice if you don‚Äôt want to use actual fruit slices. I get lemon juice in glass bottles in the ‚Äúhealth food‚Äù‚Äôaisle of the grocery store.¬† || I buy a bag of organic lemons and wash and slice them all. Fast freeze the slices on a cookie sheet then toss them in a container to store in the freezer. Every day that I make my ice water I toss a frozen lemon slice in and it‚Äôs a game changer. || I would suggest cordial, but after moving to Canada from Europe, I realise that's not a thing here.

You can easily make your own though - I make it from berries, and then can it in canning jars. Once opened, I put it in the fridge. 

If you collect a lot of berries, it's a delicious thing to do with them. || Iced tea? || One thing I do not suggest if you are outside in a warm climate most of the day is tea. I accidentally started the process of making kombucha more than once because I added sugar to tea that got hot even in an insulated metal water bottle. I've had fruit end up funky as well. I do like drink powders, especially the zero sugar melon flavor from Great Value, but sometimes they make my mouth feel dry and you have a million little single use packets. Fruits like lemons and limes that can be tossed in a bag and then juiced into the water on the go are good! || Cold infuse teas are a thing. They're 'tea' bags (often not actually tea but herbal infusions) meant to brew in cold water in a few minutes rather than the few hours normal cold brewing takes.

Not really zero waste as they usually come individually wrapped, but better than buying drinks in single use bottles. I've tried Twinnings, Ahmad, and Bigelow and they're all pretty good. Bigelow are easiest to find if you're in the US, Ahmad makes actual tea flavored ones (the others are all herbal/fruit), Twinings are the only ones not individually wrapped, but they come in a plastic tub rather than cardboard box so it's kind of a wash, I usually just buy based on flavor or what I can get in person so I'm not ordering online. || It‚Äôs not zero waste, but I lovvvve the ReLyte tubs of electrolyte powder! They‚Äôre especially good if you sweat or exercise a lot (or otherwise get dehydrated). My favorite flavors are mixed berry and pink lemonade. || Honestly it‚Äôs kind of a silly answer but get a filter for your water. Filter your ice and add ice when it needs something more. This usually hits all of the right feelings but if you need more than that fruit is a good place to start and if that‚Äôs still not working you don‚Äôt want water you want lemonade/tea/soda/coffee not water. || Electrolyte tablets 100%, not only adds flavour but actually makes tap water that generally isn't high in electrolytes actually give you what you need so you aren't so thirsty. They can be picked up pretty cheap too, I get them on subscription from Amazon.

"Maxxing recycling: Is my apartment building's recycling container the best place to place recyclables, and what plastic films can be recycled?","Hi all  
I know that recycling is the least ideal of the ZeroWaste lifestyle, but I've accumulated a bit of plastics/cans/glass and I'd like to maximize the chances of them actually being recycled.  
For plastic bags, grocery stores near me have a container in front to recycle, but they don't have much information on what types of plastics be recycled. I've called the store and the city, and neither were able to answer me. I think I remember one of them have a how2recycle logo on them. Should only plastics with the how2recycle text on them be placed in those bins? Or is it all #2 and #4 plastics? Or all plastics in general?  
Also, I have cans, paper, and bottles in my house I've accumulated. My building has a recycling dumpster, but people are not very good at sorting out non-recyclables. Is there a higher chance of recycling if I drop off the containers at a recycling center (for example, [this](http://altadenarecycling.com) one is nearest my apartment) or a [store](https://www.cityofpasadena.net/public-works/recycling-resources/resident-recycling/recycling-drop-off-locations/) that offers refunds). Or are the chances all the same? 
Thank you!","If you take it directly to a recycling center and drop it in the correct bin, there is a much higher chance that it'll be sorted and recycled appropriately, assuming your location has proper recycling facilities. 

In my area, most soft plastic can be recycled. But, the infrastructure to recycle soft plastic is much rarer than for things like metal, which is valuable on its own. 

Probably best to just go to the recycling center and chat someone up to get some answers about what they actually take. || For glass, it's ideal to get it into single stream recycling.  If it makes it to a glass plant for melting, it's great. I used to work in packaging and the glass bottle plant has a dumpster for glass and they preferred to use this instead of new as it took less energy to meit it.

Some places are finding good uses for crushed glass also.  Walt Disney World has piloted this.

Zero waste lessons learned,"Unfortunately most of my life the problems with plastic waste weren‚Äôt on my radar, despite being supposedly environmentally conscious. This all changed after reading the facts about microplastics, landfills, and plastic accumulation in our bodies. At first though I felt resigned - like nothing I could do would make a difference, and that this is all on the politicians and corporations. But in the past few months I‚Äôve made some progress in practical ways and am beginning to feel somewhat empowered.

1) separate trash into recycling, compost, and landfill. This was probably the highest yield. I was shocked at the volume that is compostable. And by keeping food scraps from the landfill trash, the landfill trash doesn‚Äôt become smelly/attract flies anywhere near as quickly - then one bag can stay for much longer, and even use a paper bag or no trash bag at all! 

2) toiletries - this was is relatively easy. 
-laundry detergent ‚Äî> laundry sheets in paper package 
-body wash ‚Äî> bar soap 
-hand soap/dish soap - found a local place that refills containers 
-toothpaste tablets, bamboo toothbrush

3) restaurants/cafes
-all coffee in reusable container (not plastic)
-beer preferably on draught
-bring take out containers for any takeaway 
-avoid styrofoam at all costs  
-provide feedback (positive and negative) to businesses for their practices on this 

4) groceries (the most difficult). Had to change the routine a good bit
-reusable bags, of course
-get only produce that not packed in plastic 
-make occasionally trips to bulk section for refillable pantry items (rice, sugar, oats, flour, nuts, dried fruits, etc)
-some items plastic is unavoidable - milk carton, juice carton, etc‚Ä¶ juices from concentrate are more efficient from a waste perspective. All this should be recyclable. 
-avoiding meat makes this process much easier and more practical, if able to do that. 
-I provided feedback to one store I left due to unavoidability of plastic packaging 

Still a lot of work to do 
1) maintain this and make it a routine( so it‚Äôs not stressful and not just a fad)
2) moving toward avoiding trash bags altogether
3) im sure more ways to do better will come up going forward.  
4) advocate to corps, politicians on policy change 

Though in the scheme of things, what I do may not make any noticeable impact, at least I am a bit empowered now. 

Open to more thoughts!
","It's relatively easy to get in the habit of choosing products based on their packaging. Often, you can find the most un-plasticy packaging at health-food stores, although the prices are higher. I'm so used to this that I've become a bit obsessive about it. For example, you can buy toilet paper in single rolls wrapped in paper. You can also look for a brand that uses 100% recycled pulp and does not use bleach. We got sold a ridiculous fantasy by advertising that we have to have bright white super fluffy TP and paper towels, which is pure nonsense.

In the NY/NJ area there's a local company called Marcal that makes 100% recycled paper products at the low end of the price range. Made in USA too, which is a bonus. Look for such brands and find stores that carry them.

Also, if your home storage space permits bulk purchases, that helps too.

Depending on your municipal trash regulations, try getting some heavy-duty lawn and leaf bags from a hardware store or Costco. They're made of thick paper and can handle all trash except the wettest stuff. If you're putting your wet scraps in a compost bin, and if your town doesn't require that you bag the rest of your trash in plastic, you can use these bags instead for your regular nonrecyclable trash. It might mean rinsing out your trash bin a bit more often.

Also, you can say no to the extra plastic wrappings at the deli counter. I get weird looks every time I ask for my cold cuts to be wrapped only in paper, but I'm not the only one who does.

You're right that this will not solve the plastic crisis - that will require legislation, and big surcharges to companies that use nonbiodegradable packaging. We're nowhere near that, but ""action now"" is the rule. || If you're a woman, or have a woman in your life, resuable menstrual products cut down alot of waste (and cost!) for me. || You're doing great! Another option is to save leftover jars, bits of soap, etc and make your own surface cleaning, and use up the left over stuff like the dish soap at the bottom of containers. 

The trash separating was such a quality of life upgrade for me! As a person with ADHD, I had a lot of struggles making sure I put my garbage out before bugs came and it stunk up my house.  Now I have a house I'm not grossed out by, and actual enjoy being in and inviting people over to. 

Plastic creep is the biggest struggle. No matter what I do, it still keeps finding its way into my home. I live in Canada, and have been using If You Care recycled garbage bags but then the boycott hit and I can't find them in my country anymore and there's no equivalent. :( || For the meat buying, I actually saw a woman at the butcher counter the other day bring her own stainless steel container and had the butchers tare the weight and package her meat in it. I don‚Äôt know why I never thought of doing that before‚Ä¶ || I appreciate all of this, and I certainly strive to accomplish as much of it as I can, I just wanted to point out a few things that make it more difficult in some areas, such as mine. 

Unfortunately not all areas (or store chains) can use anything. Each store has rules that can be restricted even further by the local government in which they operate in. 

The store I worked at was the test store of a major national chain. Due to this, refilling containers brought in was out of the question as the corporate office was constantly at our store. Since this was against the rules, we had to abide by it while a less visited store might have a little leeway. 

Also, we were dictated as to what we could do with the unsold bakery items (read: dumped in the trash). This went into effect during Covid and was not reversed. Mind you, one state could donate everything to shelters and hand them out to homeless. Why? Because that state passed a law requiring stores to do so‚Ä¶ specifically food could not be dumped unless it was beyond consumption (i.e. mouldy). 

Some of the coffee shops still hold to the rules of not being allowed to fill outside containers. While I hate it, finding the ones that do are few and far between where I live. 

In the aftermath of Covid, some areas keep their rules in place from that period of time. Do we like it‚Ä¶ no. But it is law. While wasteful, stores in those areas have to go by them (health department visits are no fun). Trust me, when I worked in the store I was in, I (along with some of my department members) asked time and time again whether we could go back to the old rules or change the current rules to be less wasteful. Management‚Äôs response (with major attitude backing it) was a resounding ‚ÄúNo‚Äù and threatening to write us up, suspend us or fire us if we kept bringing up the point or if they caught us doing anything against these rules (including putting food outside the lockable dumpster for the homeless to grab at night).

On a positive note, I will add that years ago (pre-Covid), I saw a news report on food wrappings in stores in the UK. Instead of plastic, it was required that an environmentally friendly cellophane (compostable, I think) be used for wrapping food, at least at the stores they were speaking to. Now if only we can expand that to other countries. If only I could find that video again‚Ä¶ ü§î || one of my easiest swaps was stocking up on / making kitchen towels & rags. tbh, i now use them in place of almost everything i used to use a paper towel for. spilled something? wipe it up with a rag/towel. need to clean? use a rag/towel. drying hands/dishes/whatever? use a rag/towel. need a napkin while you‚Äôre eating? use a rag/towel. it was a pretty simple swap and you can cut up old & unusable towels/clothes to make more :) || Re: #3: There is only so much individuals can do - this is largely a problem of the systems we have in place that you and I can‚Äôt overcome. Instead of saying g you can do better (you seem to be doing a great deal), say you will pressure corporations and the government to do better.",37,ZeroWaste,2025-08-17 22:56:05,zero waste lessons

Tell me how you reduce your waste in your homes üòä,"What are some of the things you do to reduce your waste at home?

I would love some inspiration ‚úåüèºüåø","Instead of going out and hunting for zero waste products to use in my home, I look at the products I already have in my home and use the heck out of them. That stack of yogurt tubs that I've saved for leftovers? Yes they are plastic. Yes eventually they are going to end up in the trash. But I can use them several times to store leftovers before throwing them out and since I'm going to buy the yogurt anyways and it's going to come in one of those tubs, instead of going out and buying specific glass or metal containers for leftovers I make a point of reusing. 

I've also had to remind myself not to let the pursuit of perfection become the enemy of good. I am never going to be 100% zero waste. It is just not going to happen. So I could throw my hands up and say oh this is too hard and it doesn't matter anyway. Or I can choose a few ways to reduce my waste and focus on those. So yes I still use Ziploc bags. Not often, but sometimes they are the best possible option for what I need to do and instead of berating myself I use them and I remind myself that I have managed to eliminate my paper towel usage almost completely by using old clothing and sheets as cleaning cloths. I do have paper towels in my home, but I'm pretty sure the roll that I have going right now has been going since before the start of the year. || Lots of food gets frozen if not eaten. Pretty much anything can be frozen (except lettuce and a few other raw veg with high water content).

Even fruit can be frozen if getting to the ‚Äúoverripe stage‚Äù; blend & freeze in ice cube trays.

Ends of bread get turned into breadcrumbs & all crumbs from biscuits, pies, etc is saved.

Linen napkins. Never used paper napkins at home. Bought good quality napkins & been using them for 25 years. || Buy less. || Silicon resealable ziplock bags, that can be washed and reused as saved so much plastic waste in our house. While still being good for keeping food fresh. || Mutual Aid Society / Buy Nothing Network / Gift Economy 

Never any packaging because everything comes to you used and unwrapped. Rarely waste because there's always someone who wants what you've got to get rid of ‚Äî even if it's ten pounds of wine corks. || Keep any scraps that would produce odors in a container in the freezer instead of putting them in the trash. Then, because there is no longer wet/gross stuff in the trash, you don't need a trash bag.

Switch to bar soap in paper packaging. I use it for everything. Dishes, shaving, laundry (I do mine by hand), body, and hair (I have straight/fine hair. Your results may vary). || I don't buy wrapping paper. I only use plain (for any occasion) reusable gift bags or fabric.

I don't use paper towels unless it's too gross for fabric, so only a roll every year or two.

Right after we got married 20+ years ago, I bought 50 medium size glass plates for hosting parties and showers. I still have all of them and don't buy paper. If we ever have more people than that, I'll buy more real plates. I also bought enough flatware for back then, but could now think about adding a set for now. I'll do that from a thrift store if I can. 

I occasionally buy linen napkins to match whatever color scheme, but I really try to work with whatever colors we already have.

I thrift a lot of our party/hosting decor.

We got bidets and use less TP.

I keep three small hoards: glass jars, boxes, and paper (delivery) grocery bags. I pull from them all the time and rarely buy other stuff for those needs. (And I could use an idea for all the bags. The collection is growing large. I'm thinking origami. I've also made storage bins, but they are flimsy.)

We thrift our needs when we can. 

I'm learning to sew. I'd like to get out of fast fashion for my clothes.

We try to shop local, especially for larger purchases.

We live in a newer hi rise with more density for a smaller carbon footprint.

We have one car and don't drive it much. || Bar soap, shampoo bar, trying to find more beauty products that are in glass containers. Can‚Äôt quite get into the menstrual cup or period underwear game, but I use no-applicator tampons. I‚Äôve tried a biodegradable pad company called August but I haven‚Äôt been very impressed with their products. 

Reusable cutlery and containers that I can bring to work for meals there, as well as a lunch box (but bags of any kind can be reused well here). Reusable water bottle, coffee cup, and tea ball for loose leaf tea. 

Composting stuff that I can compost (i have a subscription with a local composting company, but I know some municipalities have their own composting that they do and some folks have their own personal composting bins at their homes). For things like vegetable scraps or chicken carcasses, I freeze those to make stock for soups and other recipes. || When your current cleaning chemicals run out, switch to cleaning chemicals that are highly concentrated. || I want to built those Plastic Bottle extruders to make plastic bottles into Filliment to use with my 3D Printer. But, we get Shampoo that's old and use it for Cleaning same with Body wash. Like, if they have a little bit in them we fill them up with water. We also focus on needs and not wants when it comes to food. || Our efforts are built around composting and recycling. Besides that, we have basically eliminated plastic bags by using reusable silicone bags food bags and 4 oz baby food containers for food prep. We also try to buy in bulk when it makes sense and we've switched to compostable kitchen trash bags to avoid putting unnecessary plastic into landfill.

Next on my hit list is switching back to powder laundry detergent (which I generally hate) and buying cloth napkins. || First was getting into vermicomposting. Feed all my organic waste to them. Then, I moved all fresh veggies and fruit to the fridge door. So I can see them and hopefully eat it before going bad. || Buy less things || We use washable ‚Äúpaper towels‚Äù. They are awesome, used to spend so much on paper towels and now we don‚Äôt. Need em. || Well, I am on a homestead farm‚Ä¶.

One thing I try to do is reuse my waste through composting. Not everything can be composted though.

I also try to avoid single use plastics and rarely find it not possible. In which case I put it in the recycle bin.

I try not to waste electricity which is from solar Angela on the roof. 

I am on a well. So I try to not waste water, we have a grey system for outside‚Ä¶. 

I try to repurpose and re-use as much as I can. 

I still have trash. Less than most. But I think the goal needs to be to always do and seek ways to do better, rather than to be perfect. || This is such an interesting topic for me!

Empty Plastic Motor oil jugs,"Every time I change my oil im saddled with the guilt of having to throw away 6 perfectly good plastic bottles once I empty all of the oil out of them into my engine. Anyone got any ideas for what could be done with them? To be used for almost anything it would require a lot of time at the sink and a lot of water for the oil inside to be completely gone from each bottle.

to add: if they're empty, and unused, still bring back to ecocenter (as is, not washed) as they have distinct disposing methods of what they consider ""solids contaminated with oil"" or something like that such as empty jugs, stained cardboard, ditry rags, etc. it really has to be handled properly for the sake of our future. || Motor oil shouldn't be going down your sink and that's a lot of water waste for very little results.

Are wool dryer balls as effective for pet hair as Bounce dryer sheets?,"I have 3 cats and one of them sheds like crazy. His hair literally velcros to every single fabric I own. Before I started using the Bounce Pet Hair & Lint Guard dryer sheets it was so time-consuming and stressful dealing with his hair. They really were a savior for me. Especially working in food service and coming into work with cat hair on me. Having to lint roll/use rubber brush on every single piece of clothing and my blankets was driving me insane. The dryer in my apartment is also super old and crappy so that doesn‚Äôt help. I really would love to not have to buy these anymore if there‚Äôs a more sustainable alternative. And I brush him every single day and he‚Äôs on the best diet I can afford to help with the shedding. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!
","[removed] || Unfortunately, no || I use the dryer sheets you posted 2-3 times before tossing them. It isn't the greatest zero waste option, but it's what works for us. || No, but I don‚Äôt want that residue on my clothes. || I bought these: https://furzapper.com/. They do OK. || I have some dryer balls that are kind of Velcro hook side textured and they collect hair pretty well without being disposable or putting a layer of fabric softener all over my clothes || Do you use vinegar in your laundry?  It acts as a fabric softener and can help release pet hair from clothes. || Depends on the ball. Literally within a sack of seemingly identical wool balls it seems to vary wildly. I've managed to find 1 pretty decent ball and 3 mediocre ones. All 4 together equals roughly 2 really good dryer sheets. I do think it was worth sorting through probably 15-21 balls slowly testing them because now I can dry towels without having to choose between cat hair or weird residue || We toss our most dog fur covered items in the dryer for about ten minutes before washing and it really helps.....

I have this thing which I love. It's reusable, unlike sticky lint rollers, and I use it regularly on clothes and furniture. It self cleans when you ""sheathe"" it and all the hair and lint gets balled up at the end where you can grab it and throw it in the trash. Game changer for me with four cats, two dogs, and a rabbit (the worst offender, he's angora) || I thought dryer sheets were a scam. Do they actually do something? || I change into ‚Äúcat clothes‚Äù when I get home, keep them in a separate basket, and wash them separately from my activewear or other going out clothes. It‚Äôs not the most convenient, but it really helps. || So, I have more cats than you which means I am covered in a lot more fur. I go outside and I shake out big things like blankets and comforters. I run a cycle for air dry only before I actually wash clothes in the washer. I reuse the bounce dryer sheets more than once, with the wool balls. It helps. It‚Äôs not perfect but it helps. 

In short: sadly, no. Wool balls won‚Äôt fix it all. || I use tennis balls. Real tennis balls, not the pet safe kind that are just lower quality. Not sure how they managed to market that.

Looking for Dish Soap Recommendations!,"Hi y‚Äôall! I've been steadily making progress in reducing my waste over the past decade. I'm a big fan of reusable cotton produce bags. Ironically, my favorites are the ones that would have been trash if I hadn't saved them, not the ones I purchased a decade ago. I order coffee in bulk and roast it myself, and I adore the cotton bags it comes in for produce. This is one swap that has gone over very well in my household. 

I live with my parents, and they are open to some zero-waste swaps. We live in Los Angeles, so some swaps have been easy to make due to law changes, including bringing reusable bags, reusable straws, etc. I'm finally convincing them to make more swaps, including hand soap, laundry, and dishwasher tablets.

No matter how hard we try, we cannot keep my dad from washing many dishes by hand, even though we use our dishwasher. This is unlikely to change, so I'm looking for some low/zero-waste swaps for dish detergent for hand washing dishes. I don't think he would be very open to a powder like Blueland or a dish bar. Are there any alternatives that any of y'all recommend, possibly tablets you dissolve in reusable containers or large refillable options? We‚Äôre also looking for items that aren't horrifically expensive, as we are on a budget. 

For context, I am in Northeast Los Angeles. There are some refill shops near me, but I'm not sure that is the most economical option.","I tried two different dish bar soaps and was not impressed with either. They didn't last long and they didn't seem to do a great job. Not sure if this can be said for all bars. 
I use Blueland powder dish soap and really like it. I've read recently that their ""compostable"" packaging has been called into question though. || Naturebee and cleanery both do powder to gel packets - still packaging but less.

I'm in Canada though, so not sure if that works for you too! Also, awesome tip someone at an eco store gave me once.

Suggestions on truly biodegradable/100% plant-based wet wipes,"Pretty much what the title says. I am due to restock the wet wipes I use in the bathroom and I was wanting to be more responsible about what I use. It's my understanding that many wipes use plastic and I know many companies will slap a label on products that say ""plant-based"" or some other environmentally friendly buzz word, only to find out they are still like 50% plastic or something. Rather than wasting tons of time scouring labels in the grocery store, I was hoping this thread may have some quick and trusted suggestions. I would like something I can throw in my compost bin* or burn**.

*I know that there are lots of opinions about human waste in compost, but I would like to clarify that I don't actually use the material as compost because I'm too lazy to do all the work of turning it and really making sure to balance materials for optimal soil nutrients, etc. It is simply where I dispose of my biodegradable food scraps, garden trimmings and other related materials to naturally break down and not take up space in the trash.

**If you're wondering why not burn the regular wet wipes, it is my understanding that many have plastic included, which then releases harmful toxins into the air/atmosphere, so even if burning, they still need to be 100% plant-based.","Hello!

Producing new wipes no matter how ‚Äúgreen‚Äù they are is less environmentally friendly than using what‚Äôs available. || The packaging is in no way eco friendly, but have you tried the Kandoo brand?

I send these to be industrially composted (non-human waste) without issue. || I work in the production of spunlace nonwoven fabrics, which are widely used as the base material in wet wipes. You are absolutely right ‚Äî many wipes on the market contain polyester or other synthetic fibers, which means they don‚Äôt fully break down in compost or when burned.

If you want something truly plastic-free, you should look for wipes made from **100% viscose (rayon)** or other natural cellulose fibers. These are plant-based, biodegradable, and will naturally break down without releasing harmful substances. On the other hand, wipes that contain polyester (even in a 50/50 blend) are not fully biodegradable, even if they are labeled as ‚Äúplant-based.‚Äù

My advice is:

* Check the fabric composition on the packaging ‚Äî if it says **100% viscose** (or sometimes ‚Äú100% cellulose‚Äù), it‚Äôs compostable and safe to burn.
* Avoid anything that mentions polyester (PES) or polypropylene (PP).

As a supplier, we always recommend our partners to clearly label whether their wipes are 100% viscose or a blend, so that consumers like you can make an informed choice.

Advice Please!,"Hello everyone! I‚Äôm doing my best, as we all are, to reduce the amount of waste that my household is producing. I‚Äôve been going back & forth in my head about some things & thought y‚Äôall might have some ideas. 

- I have some cotton underwear that is on its last legs (elastic wearing out, etc.) Would these be appropriate as rags? We‚Äôre in a one bedroom & use some old towels my MIL gave us to clean the kitchen & bathroom.

- I have a massive collection of pill bottles, unfortunately. When we fry something (rarely), I normally pour the oil into the bottle & toss it that way. Is there a better use for my pill bottles? Can I donate them somewhere?

- I learned about eco bricks today! There‚Äôs already soft plastic recycling in my area that I separate from the things that can go in the regular recycling bins. But for the plastics that can‚Äôt be recycled, are eco bricks a good option? I don‚Äôt have any use for them in my current situation, so what could I do with a brick once full?

- We have cats & I always make sure to recycle their canned food. I‚Äôd like to switch to a more sustainable/natural litter, but my compost service doesn‚Äôt accept pet waste. What would be the best way to dispose of it?

Thank you all in advance!!!","Make sure to remember that some times, you are going to make waste. Your body makes waste, your cats make waste, we all make waste. Idk that I would use underwear as a rag, but certainly old clothes in a similar state. For your pill bottles, I think you‚Äôre giving a them a great use. Consider using them to store things like pins or change, etc. 

Like I said, we all are going to produce some waste at times and there are things that unfortunately you can only change so much on without either losing your marbles in the process or another issue, such as a health concern. Do what you can with your effort and choices, it‚Äôs already way more than a lot of people are doing. || I‚Äôm gonna say using old underwear as a rag is an up to you thing! I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing it since it‚Äôs fabric on its way out and it‚Äôs just me and my fiance in my house. || Cotton makes the best rags of all - absorbent, low static, and gentle on furniture. Go for it!

I recently cut up a beloved jacket that I wore for years, made of Indian cotton. It had gotten pretty shredded and I kept thinking I'd find a way to patch it. It makes excellent cleaning cloths for all sorts of uses.

Litter needs to go in general trash, for sanitary/disease reasons. For example, cat poop can carry the toxoplasmosis parasite, which can cause blindness in a fetus if the mother inhales the dust. (I speak as someone who loves cats and fosters rescues.) So with litter, your approach is the right one: find a low-impact, biodegradable litter that your cats like. I use World's Best, which is corn-chaff based, low dust, clumps well, and the cats like it. It unfortunately comes in a plastic sack (they used to use heavy paper), so I compromise on that, but use the sacks for noncompostable trash. 

I'm not sure about pill bottles - some municipalities accept them along with other hard plastic. Maybe you can find a recycler that does? Honestly, I suspect that much of the hard plastic I so carefully separate and put in the recycling bin ends up thrown in a landfill anyway. || I feel like this is the weirdest coincidence, but I was scrolling Instagram right before I saw your post and this lady COCOPLUM had a post showing how many pill bottles she got sent in, because she recycles them into sunglasses!

Also when looking up the sub rules on posting links, I saw that someone made a post about her. So [www.cocoplumco.com](http://www.cocoplumco.com) Though they don't pay for shipping unfortunately. || If the fabric is 100% cotton, you can cut the elastic off and bury it and it‚Äôll turn into dirt. You can also shred it to create stuffing for pillows and other sewing projects. 

Pill bottles make nice spice and seed containers. You can find more upcycling DIYS if you search ‚Äúpill bottle crafts‚Äù.

The most common use for eco bricks is using them as retaining wall blocks in gardens. You can also tie them together and cover them with shredded rags and a cloth cover to make furniture such as footstools and couches. 

Carnivore droppings aren‚Äôt generally considered safe to compost because of the bacteria, and to my knowledge/in my opinion there isn‚Äôt any perfect way to not have waste when it comes to cat litter. Some litters are more eco-friendly than others, though your choice of litter should depend on personal research and figuring out what works best with your current lifestyle. || You can donate pill bottles to local animal shelters. They are always in need of them. || * I use any cotton clothes for rags. I just cut them into unrecognizable pieces.  
* I use pill bottles for little flower vases, cutting flowers from my garden. I also use them for various bits and bobs.
* Ecobricks are better than landfill, but if you have reduce or recycle options, I think those are better. I thought of using them in a cob wall, but that hasn't materialized. 
* Can't help with the cat issues. || You could always cut the underwear into strips and weave them together [like this](https://i.etsystatic.com/27389239/r/il/97b993/3444242954/il_570xN.3444242954_jjfv.jpg) (to avoid them looking overtly like underwear üôÇ) || I use okocat litter, and the poops/clumps get flushed. The remainder I do compost (I have a large forested yard. I figure it‚Äôs less risk than the many outdoor cats in my neighborhood that likely poop outdoors. This compost is NOT used for food garden) || I researched cat litter when I got my cat and was devastated when I found out I couldn‚Äôt compost it! It is POSSIBLE to compost if you have the space and facilities and knowledge and energy to create a high heat compost, but that is beyond my capacity for sure. And, if you have an abundance of land it is possible to bury somewhere away from things it could contaminate BUT it‚Äôs treated basically like toxic waste, because of the toxoplasmosis risk. So mine goes in the trash unfortunately. I use wood pellets (okocat) so at least it will biodegrade in the landfill. 

For pill bottles, I‚Äôm pretty sure in my area pharmacies take them back for recycling. 

And I would totally use those undies for rags (just cut em up so they don‚Äôt look like underwear, if you‚Äôre worried about someone seeing them and thinking that it‚Äôs gross. It‚Äôs just psychological, they get washed!) || It used to be quite common to use old underwear as cleaning rags. I still have a few squares of my dad's old long johns among the dishcloths!

But remember, your home is not a landfill. If you can't reuse things it's okay to let them go. We know you did your best. || I personally use horse bedding pellets for cat litter. Not really any way to better dispose of cat waste but the more basic the cat litter the better. 

For old underwear and socks what I did was use them as extra stuffing in my pillows. || Consider donating your pill bottles to an organization like [Matthew 25 Ministries](https://m25m.org/pillbottles/).

Struggling to ditch cling film in the kitchen,"Trying to cut plastic in my kitchen in Manchester, UK, but cling film‚Äôs tough to replace. I use it for leftovers or wrapping veg, but it piles up in the bin fast. Tried beeswax wraps, but they don‚Äôt seal tight for wet stuff like cut tomatoes, and cleaning them‚Äôs a faff.

any solutions you guys can think of?","Silicone bags, reusable containers with lids, save glass jars from jams and sauces, aluminum foil is highly recyclable and easier to clean || Reusable containers? 

I think the trick is to have enough of them and good quality. I bought a set of 10 or so glass storage containers and never need plastic film or zipper bags any more. Glass ones are way better than plastic which get stained and don‚Äôt do well in the dishwasher. || If you need to put stuff in a thing, why does it have to be cling film?  Get some glass bowls with lids. || I stopped buying cling film a long time ago. Giving it up is mostly psychological and you'll find that other options work well enough that you won't miss it. The only thing you're really giving up is the neat aesthetics of a nonwrinkly wrapping.  Your cut tomatoes will be fine in a reusable lidded container.

Among other things, I save the nonrecyclable plastic bags or wrapping from other packaging, such as paper towel rolls and the times when cling wrap is already on a package of something (if not greasy). Rinse it off and reuse it multiple times. 

For a large bowl of food in the fridge (e.g., leftover salad), I simply put a glass dinner plate on top of the bowl. Is this perfect? No. Is it what everyone used routinely and effectively prior to the 1960s? Yes. 

One other fallback option, although not zero-waste: buy a couple of plastic shower caps with elastic edges. Look for some that are sturdy and will hold up with repeated washing. 

The disaster of unrecyclable plastic film is a much bigger health problem than we want to imagine. We're poisoning our children's planet at a shocking rate. In that context, giving up that mid-20th-century image of the pristine plastic-wrapped kitchen is not so hard. || For cut tomatoes, use a glass container and put the cut side against the bottom of the glass. || Jars. || Cut tomatoes: place them cut side down on anything: plate, tupperware etc. and refrigerate. Works for onions too. For cucumbers and bell peppers, I just put them in the fridge naked and when I use them again, just cut off the dried part.

I do use beeswax for some stuff but not produce. || The only way to get away from cling film is to change your mindset about why you need cling film. The only way I was able to stop using it all together was when I decided I was going to put any leftovers in a reusable container with a lid then the original bowl gets washed. 

Next level was that I started serving things straight in the leftover container (mine are glass and very attractive) which cut out a step and saved me water from washing. || I wash and store my lettuce in my salad spinner. I  put my half tomatoes in my salad spinner with my lettuce. Plates over bowl top. I save the bags from cereal to reuse. || Use glass containers.

How large are your tomatoes that you need to save them? Just put them upside-down in a plate. || I found silicone lids for my Corelle bowls. || A lot of half cut veg I don't wrap in anything, I find it dries out a little bit but can either be used as is of for some things (eg banana) once a small slice is cut off the end it's fine to use. Small things like half banana, onion, pepper etc I usually store in the salad draw or egg section as these are both at eye level in my fridge which increases the chance they'll be used.

Leftovers and anything wet go in reusable containers (most of which are plastic but have been collected over the years). 

Packed lunch stuff like sandwiches go in a lunchbox. If there's extra room that it might slide around I use other food around it to cushion it. If it really seems like it's gonna fall apart I wrap in tinfoil. 

I've used the silicone bowl covers and they're good for some things but they can be an awkward fit if you don't have the right size bowl. A plate on top of a bowl works just as well and has the bonus of being able to stack things on top.

Another altenative for on top of bowls is shower caps. These are especially great for proving dough.

If I'm resting pastry and need it to be truly airtight I wrap it in the compostable food caddy bags provided by the council and then use it as a bin liner after. Probably not tested as food safe but I've had no issues with it. || Haven‚Äôt bought cling wrap in a decade. I‚Äôve tried beeswax wraps as well, not my favorite. What I‚Äôve found works best is storing in glass jars/bowls! Mason jars of all sizes are multi use. I also save various size food jars. If you have a larger bowl/container you want to save food in, you can always cover it with a plate or reusable cloth covers. I believe they make reusable silicone cling wraps and bowl covers but I haven‚Äôt tried those personally. On rare occasion, I also use recycled aluminum foil wrap some things which is still better than plastic. Some places recycle this but don‚Äôt forget to clean it off first! || I love pyrex and corelle together. the corelle plates fit almost perfectly over round pyrex, and also their corresponding-sized corelle bowls. Depending on the food item I use the plate or the bowl as the ""lid"" and this cuts out 99.oercent of need for plastic anything. || I use silicon lids. You can get them at any store. They self seal. ||   
For us, we tried purchasing a 'set' of reusable containers that contained a variety of sizes and shapes. After struggling with 3 sets, I gave them all away. Having so many sizes made storage difficult and I often used cling film because I didn't the right size (specifically the ones that I had were often too small).  
The solution was to buy and create a personal set. For our family we use:  
15 - 16 oz glass storage containers, round  
15 - 32 oz glass storage containers, square  
15 - 34 oz plastic storage containers, rectangular  
4 - 11 cup glass storage containers, rectangular

Because we have so many, I'm able to store everything that needs to be stored, from leftovers, to weekly food prep, snacks, ...  
I'm not dealing with an ungodly variety of lids, which is life changing. Also, everything stacks. However, for some of the glass storage containers, I store them with lids on. This increases ease of usage and looks nice.  
Lastly, I would suggest purchasing from reputable brands, legacy brands, where the item has been in production for years. You can buy replacement lids or refresh your plastic set when needed. 

It's an investment, but I'm on 15 years now. I'm still using the same cling film box from 15 years ago. || We typically put cut vegetables in one our super old Tupperware containers. Leftovers go in an old corningware, Pyrex or similar container/ lidded casserole. The only vegetable that I‚Äôve nerved to wrap is avocados but you could put that in a container and rub olive oil on the cut. Think, what would your grandmother have done? Sometimes we have an old plastic lid from something which we set on a bowl. If you want to wrap food for lunches you can use parchment paper or a sandwich box. My lunchbots tin holds a sandwich AND it‚Äôs sturdy. 

I‚Äôd rethink all the silicone bags etc, they‚Äôre just rebranded plastic. || The beeswax should seal just fine. You put your veggie in a ceramic or glass or even plastic container, and then put the beeswax over the top and you have to hold your hands on it so your body heat warms the wax enough for it to adhere to itself creating the seal. You can even do it without a bowl as long as you hold the open ends together after folding them somewhat neatly, and it will adhere to itself. || I collect more and more glass containers with lids

Giving things a ‚Äúsecond life‚Äù,"Ok I‚Äôm just learning the zero waste way, and now don‚Äôt like to throw things out. So feel more motivated to reuse things and give them a ‚Äúsecond life‚Äù. The problem I‚Äôve run into is that a lot of times this second life is artificial, created just to avoid throwing the thing out, doesn‚Äôt really reduce additional resource use, and just clutters my life. And ive started to accumulate piles of things that are awaiting a new use. At some point I just need to bite the bullet and throw this stuff out. How do people navigate this?","I love this quote to help me manage this kind of attitude. ‚ÄúThe world doesn‚Äôt need a few people doing zero waste imperfectly.

If you can, compost food waste. Try to buy food in recyclable containers, especially glass and aluminum. Don‚Äôt buy things you don‚Äôt need. Take refuge in the fact that you are doing better than you might be. || Your house is not a landfill. If the things you are keeping are not being used, it‚Äôs trash. 

But, one woman‚Äôs trash is another man‚Äôs treasure. You might not have a dog, but your neighbor on Buy Nothing can use your plastic bread bags for dog poop once you collect enough. 

You can also identify the sources of waste in your life and try to reduce them. If you keep forgetting your reusable bags, set an alarm on your phone to restock the bags in your car on Sunday night. || I have a couple of spots where I keep very specific things I want to reuse‚Äîglass jars & bottles, paper grocery bags, things to repair, and scrap fabric. I almost always keep those things, store them, and then have specific uses for them.

Everything else, I compost, throw away, sell, give away, or recycle. Once in awhile, I find something out of the box I want to reuse, and I google DIY ideas using that specific thing, and then put it in my craft area so I don‚Äôt forget. ||  often my answer to what can one do with this is donate. I don't need the mug I don't want to become idk a planter if I don't need one, nor my old tshirt to be a 100th tote bag ....etc.....

I get wanting to reuse stuff but in reality plenty of it is maybe needed or wanted somewhere else as is. 

even glass jars and plastic containers, knick knack etc.....

I give give away the stuff , even gravel and soil you can find people interested....

If I don't use something anymore I just donate it.

charity shops, freecycle, buy nothing groups, local website ...etc . or people you know? || You have come to the realization that these things have no real post consumer use.   There are just too many.....too many soluitions and very few needs..

Most of what people do with theses things is not needed or wanted and stil ends up in the landfill.

You are already smarter than the average bear.   

The best that we can do is not consume so darned much in the first place.  So much of what makes this mess o' stuff is pretty much useless or totally unneeded, as well.

That is just the plain old truth to it. || The number one step in this is ‚Äúrefuse.‚Äù Simply don‚Äôt buy new things. That‚Äôs where all this begins. One petroleum has been turned into plastic, there‚Äôs nothing that can be done to undo that. 

Make sure to forgive yourself for your past spending habits, but do change your FUTURE behavior. That‚Äôs where you can really make a difference || What kinds of things are you accumulating? Things like empty egg cartons, yogurt containers, toilet paper rolls are nicer in bulk to donate to a local school, daycare, library, etc for crafts. you can also post to Buy Nothing (facebook group) or Next Door and someone else might be able to make use of it. || Some things ya just gotta turf. Minimize where you can.

I hoard takeout containers because if I bake food I can give some away without worrying about getting back a dish/container. I like to pick blackberries in the summer, and sometimes I'll take extra takeout/yogurt containers because there's usually kids trying to use their shirts as a container. But if you don't bake/give people food often, it's not something that makes sense to keep.

I've definitely hoarded some things just in case, and they pretty much never have a use if I can't think of one within a couple minutes. || Here some things that help me 

First

Asking myself - If you can think of a new use for an item? 

If not Then you give it away so someone else can use it.

Second 

I seen eps of hoarders and always keep that in the back of my mind so I‚Äôll never slip into a moment where I become that. 

Don‚Äôt feel bad for not keeping an item. Remember health first before eco friendly/ zero waste. Making a home a landfill isn‚Äôt healthy. || If an item is usable, offer it to your community. E.g. replacing microwave? Well ask if anyone can take old one of your hands. Especially if you're in student's town, you'll be surprised how many 'someone's trash, other person's treasure' you find. Even glass bottles etc, maybe someone in neighborhood is looking for pickling jars. 

And do very mindful shopping going forward. But also don't feel bad about throwing things away, sometimes it happens. || Always remember to keep an eye out for recycle centers that you can sort plastics yourself. || giving stuff away and recycling in this order is also a good enough solution.
as a millennial i hate throwing away sturdy boxes, but i also hate the texture of cardboard (some sensory issue), so i know i won't reuse it.
but before i would throw them in the paper waste bin (which is already a solid option imo), i would ask in local zero waste groups if anybody would use it.
you personally don't have to reuse stuff if u dislike the actual thing. but you can always ask ur local community. there is always a chance someone would take it. || I will often set nicer trash/recycling off to the side until trash day to see if I can find a use for it before then, and if not it goes out on trash day


Storing items that have no real use in your home instead of just accepting the inevitable is just wasting your living space with no benefit to anyone


Reuse what has a real use. Give away what others are likely to use. Recycle what you can. And try not to waste energy on things that you know are trash. Reducing consumption is often the better place to focus


See if you have a center for creative reuse near you.

We have a hazmat facility for cords, old tech, and hazardous waste containers like paint and paint cans. We have places where you can return toner cartridges so they don't go into the landfill.  Ad nauseam. 

Figure out what goes where before tossing shit. Some things aren't even donatable but there may be a place for them somewhere else. Otherwise, just landfill it and stop feeling bad.

Why are safety razors so bad?,"I feel like I'm going insane. I'm 25 and have been removing my body hair since I was 11. I tried safety razors before and was unsatisfied with the shave so went back to disposable ones. I'm trying to get along with my new safety razor for the sake of the planet and it's so bad!

I'm getting strawberry skin, rashes, and the shave is so much worse compared to a plastic razor. Does anyone know why this is? I feel so gross and my skin is really irritated, even with my usual scrubs and shaving creams. ","Are you using the same amount of pressure as you do with disposables? You don‚Äôt need to press as much with safety razors as they‚Äôre sharper. || Check out Leaf Shave. They have a razor that is like disposable ones that is eco friendly. I love mine || What kind of safety razor? Which razor blades? Are you pressing with the razor or are you letting the weight of the razor itself guide the shave? || Most razors have a gel or whatever it is to help lubricate your leg before the razor touches it. You'll need to find an alternative. Personally, I use a razor with bar soap, which provides me with enough lubrication to move the razor. Then, I do a heavy coating of shea butter when I get out and my legs are still a little wet. 

My only complaint is that I didn't get one with a moveable head. I do cut myself more because I go too fast and am not careful. But that's on me. Can't blame the razor! || ask r/wicked_edge || I'd take a look at the leaf razor - been using mine for years (my partner has one too and love it). I do also use more traditional safety razors but they are slower and I do end up nicking myself with them more often. Classic Safety razors are technique-wise more complicated to use for sure. || It's not the razor, it's the blade...different blades performed differently and they all have different coatings etc.

There's a website to get cheap sample blade packs. It's called tryablade.com. || What kind of shaving cream are you using? || Have you tried pulling up the skin above the area you're shaving? I've found that the razor does work better on your skin on certain areas if it's held taut (ankles and knees especially). 

But I agree with other comments stating you might want to invest in better blades - the ones that came with my razor sucked and I also ended up getting counterfeit ones from Amazon that were terrible. I recommend Astra for blades (just don't get them from Amazon lol).

Edit: I personally LOVE my safety razor because it gives me basically no razor burn and a much closer shave than the disposables. Plus I can do it quicker since it's double sided so I don't have to unclog as much. OP, I hope you're able to work yours out! || Maybe you‚Äôre not using it right? It needs a different angle and lighter pressure. A rash usually means you‚Äôre pressing too hard. || Following because I also have this issue. || Have you tried one of the sample packs you can get off Amazon for like $12? It will come with blades from many different brands. It‚Äôs a great way to find blades that are more ideal for your skin and facial hair. Use each half-blade for a couple shaves. Keep the other half of the blades that seem good. Then at the end, use that second half to see if those are a stand-out winner.¬†

I went through that process and narrowed it to 4 that were the best for me. Then ordered a box of one of those and am using it now. Unfortunately, I‚Äôm finding variation from one blade to the next as I go through the box, but on the whole the blades are better for me than whatever random blades I had started with.¬†

Whenever I want a good, close shave, I use my old Gillette razor since I still have ~15 replaceable blades for it. Sucks, but I already had that razor and the blades so might as well use it. I am hoping that with more time I‚Äôll get better with the safety razor¬† || Try a bunch of different blades. They're not the same, at all.
I had to try 6 different brands to find one that didn't shred my face or leave me with tons of ingrown hairs. || I just gave up shaving in the end, it was such a headache dealing with rash, patchiness, stubble! || What brand or blades are you using and what kind of shaving cream? The blades that come with the razor usually sucks. May be worth sanitizing the blades before each use with alcohol. Exfoliating and moisturizing is still necessary too || I love my safety razor and have never gotten a closer shave. I change my blade with each use since it‚Äôs recyclable. 

I use Feather and Derby. I‚Äôm not sure how it would be possible to go through four times!! Use the weight of the razor to be the ‚Äúpressure‚Äù find a good angle and go to town. 

I go with the grain of the hair for most of my skin. Against for underarm and like before the ankle. 

I think safety razors are actually far and away the best shaving experience I‚Äôve had. I hate disposables and I feel like the blade quality became super apparent after I switched. Beyond all of this, the best hair removal for my legs has still been getting waxed regularly. || I agree with you so hard. I switched to a safety razor in college and straight up just stopped shaving bc it's so much worse than a disposable. Everyone here is giving tips that I've already tried. I used my mom's disposable razor recently and was floored by how easy it was. I barely needed soap and it took me one third of the time to shave as it does with my SR. || It‚Äôs not the safety razor. You just don‚Äôt know how to shave with a safety razor. If everything you‚Äôve tried is not working, just accept you can‚Äôt use them and use a low-waste disposable razor. || Me and safety razors never got along. I tried a handful and a half dozen different blades. Whereas a [Leaf razor](https://leafshave.com) has nearly ended my need for razor cartridges. I‚Äôm five years into owning the leaf razor and have only used cartridges for my bikini zone and as the backup at work. So I went from 70ish cartridges per year to under 12. || Use way less pressure.  You don't need to press so hard as the blades are actually sharp.  Also you hold them at a different angle.

No-Plastic Deodorant WITH Aluminum,"Does such a thing exist? I use Dove, and it works well enough (nothing else I‚Äôve used keeps me from smelling like shit, anyway). But they don‚Äôt have cardboard packaging options that I‚Äôm aware of. I noticed they have that one failed refillable pod thing, but I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs trash, and refills only come in non-aluminum- I think. That one brand that was popular a few years ago (the name alludes me rn) makes deodorants in cardboard containers, but it has no aluminum. 

So annoying how the public‚Äôs scientific illiteracy caused companies to produce so many aluminum-free deodorants. Aluminum isn‚Äôt carcinogenic (and even if it actually is, there is currently not sufficient evidence to conclude so). I know there are people with aluminum allergies (a girl on my high school XC team had one), BUT COME ON. Someone make plastic-free, aluminum-containing deodorant. Fuck

Looking for a festival-friendly reusable water bottle,"Hi! I have a music festival coming up, and I won't be allowed to bring in my current every day water bottle because it's stainless steel. Metal and glass bottles aren't allowed.

I don't want to end up buying a bunch of single-use water bottles while I'm there, so I'm on the hunt for a reusable water bottle that isn't absolute garbage for the environment. I'd prefer it to be relatively small so that it can fit in my bag and won't be too heavy carrying it around all day. There will be refill stations there, so that won't be a problem.

My first thought was to try to find a used one, but honestly, I don't have a dishwasher, and I don't trust my handwashing to get all of the little gross grooves in a plastic water bottle clean enough after a stranger has used it. I guess I'd be open to cleaning tips as well if used is my only option.

Editing to add that this is actually a festival that I go to every year, so having something that I can use for more than a few days would be ideal. Very much appreciate all of the suggestions so far though!","I never fell for the latest and greatest water bottle trends. I have a nalgene widemouth that has been my buddy for at 3 decades and still going strong. Dishwasher safe.
Edited to add: if you find one used the widemouth washes well in the dishwasher. If you buy one new, you won't need to worry about it again unless you lose it. || Can you borrow one from friends or family? Less gross than an unknown stranger. || I used this ""oragami"" bottle for 4 years before it developed a small hole on the bottom. They recently came out with a new updated version addressing that issue. I got a new bottle 2.0 version and im looking forward to using it for another 4 years. Not available yet but they just fulfilled the kickstarter orders so it might be soon. That said the original held up for a long time so no complaints. Holds 25 oz water and folds down to almost nothing when empty.

https://difold.com/collections/origami-bottle-cup/products/difold-origami-bottle-v2 || Mini 16oz Nalgene and a carabiner has been my festival water solution for a decade. Small enough to clip on a fanny pack or sling, never too heavy or bulky, durable and easy to clean. || You want something like Dettol, Milton or Denture tablets for cleaning the water bottle if the thought of just washing it with soap freaks you out a bit.¬†


Anything that's used for sterilisation.


Personally, I would just reuse a ""single use"" plastic bottle, but then that's me. || I would buy a juice bottle . apple sauce  or something like that to take with me then refill it

you also have these small silicone pouches that you can buy || I just got back from the Tomorrowland festival. They do not allow glass, metal, or even hard plastic water bottles. 

Most people had either:
- a small water bladder they could clip to their belt
- a camelbak (backpack bladder) || Buy a Nalgene bottle and use it for life.  I have some that have lasted for 25 years. || is it safe to bleach and or boil a second hand nalgene waterbottle? thats what i would do to sanitize something

alternatively if its only for a single festival, ive used all kinds of packaging containers for drinking water before that were not intended as such. do you buy any food in recyclable plastic jars like yogurt or mayonnaise? a bottle for ketchup or dressing? even a plastic bottle from some previous drink? if it fits in your bag why not just rinse it out super well and use it for refills || You know that you can refill single-use bottles so they become reusable? It should be fine for the festival, and you can dispose of it properly. || Nalgene. || I have purchased water bottles second hand, and a good scrub helps figure out if it's even possible every part of the bottle clean. It's great to own a bottle cleaning brush, and tooth brushes can get the threads of the bottle clean too. || Camel pak. || Everything comes with tradeoffs, but collapsible containers tend to get an incredible amount of use, and that can prevent a lot of trash in the long run. 

Silicone is easy to find and tastes clean.  Rubber bottles aren‚Äôt hard to find, but the taste is not so clean, wouldn‚Äôt recommend. || I always bring a Camelbak and have just used that as my bag. As long as you get one that meets the zippers/compartment reqs of your fest (if they have one). I‚Äôve done this for two festivals (one I‚Äôve been to with it four times).¬† || Nalgene. Hands down. I only bought a new one after 20 years, because my ex really really wanted to keep my old one. Those things are incredible. I bring them on every long hike for extra water. || I just reuse a 'single use' bottle (usually from sparkling water) and replace it whenever I feel like it. || Buy a Gatorade or other wide mouth single use bottle and use it for the weekend or at home until it breaks. Then recycle it. I find that Gatorade bottles are pretty indestructible for $2, and they‚Äôre designed to be recycled. || For similar situations I usually just buy a normal bottle of water and keep reusing it until it‚Äôs gross || There are collapsible water bottles/bladders you can get for travel / festivals. I have two (different materials and bought years apart) and I use them for plane travel and music fests or any other instance where I want to pack light and can fill up as needed.

I thought about 3d jewellery printed business. But then thought about ecology...,Hi! I was very passionate about starting my new bussiness but then realised it kinda cannot be eco-friendly(?). First I learned that no 3d fillament is eco friendly(?). Okey so maybe without printer :( but then I read that even metal is not eco-friendly. So is it bad idea to do jewellery? Or there is a way to be ethical with it?,"Mining and smelting new metals is a toxic process, for sure. And 3d printing is just creating new plastic bits that'll never be recycled. 

But you could absolutely look into using vintage, antique, second hand components to create new pieces.

Even mixing second hand and new components would reduce the footprint of your creations, and would also be a marketing point . || To be fair, *everything* we use or consume has a negative impact on the environment since humans have long since stopped ""living in harmony with nature"" (if we ever truly did).

However, some things have a far greater and longer lasting impact. So, metal requires mining, yes. Plastic, though, requires drilling for oil *and* will literally never breakdown  *and* is largely not recyclable. 

So, given you have to support yourself, imo, making metal and stone jewelry is a better option. Good luck. || If you are able to use materials that are taken from the ""waste stream"", that can be a way to avoid further extracting from natural resources. I have seen jewelry made from broken china, old fabrics, etc. Do some research about what is being done in the field-- there's a whole world of ethical reuse in the craft universe. || PHA is truly biodegradable filament. Its not zero waste, but its definitely better than 99% of other plastics.


(Available in the US via Polar filaments and... Allfab, I think, has it across the pond.)


/r/3dprinting_PHA is full of discussion on printing with PHA.¬† || Use recycled and/or biodegradable plastic! I've seen people turn plastic bottles into filament || I have seen videos where they make filament using old plastic soda bottles, so you could try doing that if you wanted to participate in the reuse portion of the triangle. || In short **I think it‚Äôs okay to choose plastic 3D printing to make jewellery**. This comment is a little long. I have highlighted the most important parts.

**The production of plastics uses way less energy opposed to the production of metal**. Unfortunately, most energy still comes from fossil sources. So, the carbon footprint of plastic in production will be way smaller than the footprint of a metal.

Long lived things are better done in metal. Short lived things, I think are okay to make out of plastics. Or when the use case is better suited for plastics. For example, if you need something lightweight, transparent or flexible. If you are just starting out with making jewellery, you will probably not produce an heirloom. It would be overkill to use material that last generations. But you have to start somewhere, and practice the things you want to become good at.

Think about your artistic vision, and about what is available to you. **Make art, make something beautiful, that brings the wearer joy**. Then think about how you can achieve that in the most ecofriendly way for example by choosing already recycled materials. While still running a profitable business and enjoy doing it.

**If you really want to make 3D models**, work with the freedom and limitations of the 3D printing technology you choose, 3D Printing will be the way to go. Don‚Äôt mass print something you found online. Apart from the eco friendliness, **I don‚Äôt think printing someone else‚Äôs models is a good business model**, unless you find an underserved niche. Maybe you can have your models printed in metal at some point (directly or in wax and then cast in metal).

**You will only need a few grams of filament/resin for each piece.**

From my experience FDM (non resin) **3D Prints are a bit brittle**, especially PLA. The jewellery needs to be treated with care, more care than a similar design made with stainless steel for example. But jewellery is often handled with care so that‚Äôs a good application to use 3D printing, I think. I would give **3D printed jewellery a live span of 1-10 years**, depending on materials, design, print-quality (layer adhesion), UV exposure etc‚Ä¶

If that‚Äôs a no-go for you, 3D printing will not be the way to go.

If you want to make something out of wire, or smith, saw, hammer metals, do that. Recycled metals need far less energy in production. ¬†Still more than plastic production. Please make sure your solder doesn‚Äôt have lead in it if you solder! (**Pb-Free**)

Someone else has mentioned stone and ceramics as a material, I would like to add **wood and glass**. Glass uses a large amount of energy in production but is very inert. I don‚Äôt worry about glass in the environment only about stepping into a shard. And it‚Äôs recyclable. However, I wouldn‚Äôt count on jewellery getting recycled but rather that maybe you can buy already recycled glass. And I think it can look pretty. || Check out loveheylola on instagram. She makes jewellery out of upcycled materials. || recycled metal!!! || Not jewelry.  

Here‚Äôs a business idea I would love to see in the world: A furniture consignment store with a furniture repair business attached, where someone can take classes in furniture repair and that also does estate sales.

Here‚Äôs my idea: You need a large space near a mid sized city that has a wide class spectrum: upper, middle & working class residents.  A college town would be great.

You start with free stuff on Facebook marketplace and next door, fixing, repairing, re-doing furniture (painting, etc in your own style or esthetic). Build your inventory.

Start advertising for furniture consignment.  You research what consigners are paying (40%-60%, depending on your market), and follow the market.  You are very selective on what you accept by paying attention to what sells quickly on fb, etc and what they charge.

Offer classes, for a fee, in furniture repair, whatever you learn/know how to do.  Small, hands on classes over a weekend or one evening a week for a month.

Offer estate sales.  When someone wants to move or dies etc. And can‚Äôt do a garage sale, you take over, for a fee.  You bring the furniture you want to your shop.  You host a garage sale at their place.  Or/ and you sell on eBay etc.

4 lines of income (store; consignment, classes, estate sales).  You‚Äôd need to set up excellent bookkeeping for consignment transparency‚Ä¶.  I talked with a woman who had opened her consignment store in 2018.  2021 was her most profitable year.  It‚Äôs almost recession-proof.

Tips for beginners at zero waste,"Hello everyone I‚Äôve been wanting to try and cut back on my trash waste and I‚Äôm not quite sure where to start. Financially I can‚Äôt buy all the stuff at the same time, so what should I get in chronological order I guess? I have a budget of $30 biweekly for reusable items. What would you recommend ","First step, use up everything you currently have. As you run out, then replace with the sustainable options. It‚Äôs a journey and you don‚Äôt have to do everything at once. || First tip is, don‚Äôt buy anything¬† || First tip just cause you can make it don‚Äôt mean you should make it (for example trying to make cat litter or sunscreen)

Second tip- buy stuff that actually works like for example sunscreen cause it be more wasteful to end up with skin cancer then to use sun screen to help prevent it. 

Third tip- thrift and buy second hand when possible 

Four tip- pasta jars make good storage and paint cups 

Fifth tip- you can make blanket for homeless out of chip bags 

Sixth tip - health is first above everything, if you it taking care of your self you can‚Äôt be eco friendly 

7 tip - you can use foil candy wraps in collage 

8- you can save cardboard to use in shipping items, crafting and painting on 

9 - don‚Äôt feel bad if your not perfect no one is 

10 - handkerchief instead of paper napkins 

11- cloth napkins instead of paper napkins 

12- if you must buy item your use everyday buy it in wood, metal, glass or ceramic when it not single use item 

13- have one meatless meal a week of health condition if have any allow it and swap out for a plant based protein like beans

14- when you can shop at farmer market to cut down on plastic use and packaging 

15- buy in bulk weather in lots of packaging or loose causer it same more resources when it comes to packaging and container it in 

16- freeze flour before putting it in air tight container on shelf || Get a compost bin and a mini for the kitchen. 

Meal plan. That does not mean you need to cook 7 meals on Sunday night. Just have a look in your fridge and look up a recipe for that combination of food. 

We buy chicken pieces at the supermarket from the deli section which has less packaging.

My biggest weakness is strawberries and those plastic containers!! || Only replace as you use up what you have. || focus on big impact swaps (compost, refill shops, no single use plastic). Your $30 is more powerful if u do it slow and intentional. climate crisis is real, so every choice matters and im just happy to see another person trying || i agree w/ what everyone has said about using what you have, but also i think #1 swap for a lot of people is start getting glass tupperware/jars to swap out for ziploc bags ‚Äî i am amazed at how many of those some people are throwing out every week. you can also wash and reuse the bags!! || Zero waste is about reducing the waste you produce as much as you can, the best way to do this is to buy less. You can‚Äôt buy your way into zero waste, so I would recommend rethinking your consumer habits. Start by reusing and repurposing things you already have. Learn how to mend and fix things when they break before getting rid of them.
One tip for zero waste without spending money is to turn you old clothes that are no longer mendable or  wearable into rags for cleaning. || - replace paper goods with cloths (paper towels, napkins)
- use a bidet and possibly switch to using cloth to wipe instead of TP
- use one you own or buy a solid reusable water bottle (try thrift stores)
- swap from liquid body care/cleaning products to solids, powder, or more concentrated gel forms that you can dilute at home
- buy things that come in primarily cardboard or paper packaging instead of plastic tubs or boxes
- buy whole bean coffee with a grinder or looseleaf tea with reusable metal filter/steeping methods
- buy local when you can
- buy secondhand when you can
- make a point to do a regular fridge clean up to avoid food waste
- start  a compost bin

And most importantly: get through what you have, dont toss it, otherwise it will become waste. This also helps as you slowly accumulate things. || You could try make your own cleaning products its actually sooo much cheaper than buying eco friendly products and so easy most of them are a mix of vinegar, soda crystals, green bleach, citric acid. 
All v cheap to buy and they come in big bags so last ages.
Try follow nancy birtwhistle on insta she is great for saving money and doing every thing the eco way, and shares lots of recipes || USE UP WHAT YOU HAVE!

Then when you're out of shaving supplies, get a safety razor and a pack of 100 blades. I haven't spent a cent on shaving in 5 years and still have some blades left. || Do you have access to soil?

A huge part of your waste can be cut down by composting. You‚Äôll put way less ‚Äútrash‚Äù out if you don‚Äôt have food waste in the bin.

You can do trench composting which is literally digging a hole and burying your food scraps. Or you can get a compost bin. Check out the composting sub for more details.

You can usually find compost bins for free on Facebook place. Or some councils give them out for free to their citizens.

Not so fun fact: if global food waste were a country, it would be the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, behind the US and China. || Compost pile is much easier than zero waste cooking || No self shame for not being perfect.
Think about what's reasonable for your budget and lifestyle (example- plastic toys may be avoidable if you have children)
Build your zero waste lifestyle and supplies over time. Don't try to just start over from scratch.
Save old soap/detergent containers, and go to a refillery using the old containers
Get reusable paper towels
You can reuse or buy spray tops or other kinds of mason jar tops for household cleaning, and save your mason jars.
Get reusable grocery bags, ziplocs, or silicone ""saran wrap"" or beeswax.

Other random stuff: reusable toothbrush and get nonplastic, compostable brushheads for it(I use Booheads). Leafshave razors are like cartridge Gillette types without all the extra plastic and disposable crap.

But at the end of the day, just replace what you can when you can, because remember, zero waste means the reusable stuff you get is going to last a really long time and once you have it, you're gonna have it for a long ass time. Pick up the odd thing here and there and build a collection that will be accessible when you need it. 

Look up what reusables do before you buy them (example: beeswax wraps are often imbued with antimicrobial elements that can lengthen the lifespan of vegetables and cut down on food waste, whereas if microplastic shedding is an issue, and you use a lot of ziplocs like I do for cut open meats or cat food, you may want to slowly collect reusable ziplocs.)

And finally; look at your lifestyle and capacity. While the dream of absolute zero waste is admirable, not everyone can bake their own bread or make their own cleaner or hygiene products, but if you have the time and mental space for some of that, absolutely do it. Share that skill with others to further reduce waste. 

At the end of the day it's about doing what you can with what you have access to. Be a tortoise in the race and not the jack rabbit. Every small step is a massive accomplishment and lightyears ahead of where you were before. || Zero waste is not a shopping spree.  Use what you already have. || Replace things when they break or you run out. But unpaper towels/rags are a good start.",20,ZeroWaste,2025-08-10 11:31:18,tips beginners zero waste,hello everyone wanting try cut back trash waste quite sure start financially buy stuff time get chronological order guess budget biweekly reusable items would recommend,first step use everything currently run replace sustainable options journey everything first tip buy anything first tip cause make mean make example trying make cat litter sunscreen second tip buy stuff actually works like example sunscreen cause wasteful end skin cancer use sun screen help prevent third tip thrift buy second hand possible four tip pasta jars make good storage paint cups fifth tip make blanket homeless chip bags sixth tip health first everything taking care self eco friendly tip use foil candy wraps collage save cardboard use shipping items crafting painting feel bad perfect one handkerchief instead paper napkins cloth napkins instead paper napkins must buy item use everyday buy wood metal glass ceramic single use item one meatless meal week health condition allow swap plant based protein like beans shop farmer market cut plastic use packaging buy bulk weather lots packaging loose causer resources comes packaging container freeze flour putting air tight container shelf get compost bin mini kitchen meal plan mean need cook meals sunday night look fridge look recipe combination food buy chicken pieces supermarket deli section less packaging biggest weakness strawberries plastic containers replace use focus big impact swaps compost refill shops single use plastic powerful u slow intentional climate crisis real every choice matters im happy see another person trying agree w everyone said using also think swap lot people start getting glass tupperware jars swap ziploc bags amazed many people throwing every week also wash reuse bags zero waste reducing waste produce much best way buy less buy way zero waste would recommend rethinking consumer habits start reusing repurposing things already learn mend fix things break getting rid one tip zero waste without spending money turn old clothes longer mendable wearable rags cleaning replace paper goods cloths paper towels napkins use bidet possibly switch using cloth wipe instead tp use one buy solid reusable water bottle try thrift stores swap liquid body care cleaning products solids powder concentrated gel forms dilute home buy things come primarily cardboard paper packaging instead plastic tubs boxes buy whole bean coffee grinder looseleaf tea reusable metal filter steeping methods buy local buy secondhand make point regular fridge clean avoid food waste start compost bin importantly get dont toss otherwise become waste also helps slowly accumulate things could try make cleaning products actually sooo much cheaper buying eco friendly products easy mix vinegar soda crystals green bleach citric acid v cheap buy come big bags last ages try follow nancy birtwhistle insta great saving money every thing eco way shares lots recipes use shaving supplies get safety razor pack blades spent cent shaving years still blades left access soil huge part waste cut composting put way less trash food waste bin trench composting literally digging hole burying food scraps get compost bin check composting sub details usually find compost bins free facebook place councils give free citizens fun fact global food waste country would third largest emitter greenhouse gases world behind us china compost pile much easier zero waste cooking self shame perfect think reasonable budget lifestyle example plastic toys may avoidable children build zero waste lifestyle supplies time try start scratch save old soap detergent containers go refillery using old containers get reusable paper towels reuse buy spray tops kinds mason jar tops household cleaning save mason jars get reusable grocery bags ziplocs silicone saran wrap beeswax random stuff reusable toothbrush get nonplastic compostable brushheads use booheads leafshave razors like cartridge gillette types without extra plastic disposable crap end day replace remember zero waste means reusable stuff get going last really long time gonna long ass time pick odd thing build collection accessible need look reusables buy example beeswax wraps often imbued antimicrobial elements lengthen lifespan vegetables cut food waste whereas microplastic shedding issue use lot ziplocs like cut open meats cat food may want slowly collect reusable ziplocs finally look lifestyle capacity dream absolute zero waste admirable everyone bake bread make cleaner hygiene products time mental space absolutely share skill others reduce waste end day access tortoise race jack rabbit every small step massive accomplishment lightyears ahead zero waste shopping spree use already replace things break run unpaper towels rags good start
Plastic grocery bags: reuse or recycle?,"I of course abhor plastic grocery bags and refuse to use them with my groceries. But sometimes I end up with some at home (gifts, leftover from an event, etc‚Ä¶). I‚Äôve been using them as trash bags. But now I‚Äôve learned about the option to return them to the store where they will be recycled. My understanding is they are NOT reused as bags, but rather they are turned into material for other uses (ex: building materials).

So basically I have two options. 
1) continue using these as my trash bags, and they end up at the landfill. But at least I don‚Äôt have to buy any kind of trash bag
2) return to store for recycling, and then instead use small compostable or postconsumer recyclable bags (I know this is its own debate).

What do you think is the better method?
Personally I lean toward reuse > recycle but also don‚Äôt like sending these to the landfill. wanted to see what others think 


Edit: thanks for all the replies. Very variable views on this. Sounds pretty uncertain the effectiveness of return to store recycling. So I think I will keep using the leftover plastic bags as trash bags to avoid buying new trash bags. I do think an aspiration for me will be to move to paper trash bags only (no plastic bag at all). With compost and recycling, might be a reasonable goal. ","If you already have them, use them until they are torn. If the bags are new you can use them for tasks that need a watertight container. If the bag was already made and work has gone into it, it's a waste to not use it. || If you're confident that the collected bags are actually recycled and not just thrown away by the store, then definitely recycle. But also carry some in your car or bag, so that you can reuse them over and over when you buy groceries, before you recycle them.

I carry a couple of folding nylon shopping bags in my purse and I almost never use the plastic bags provided by the store. 

By far the best approach is to not use the bags in the first place. Just manufacturing them is environmentally horrible. So do all you can to reduce your initial intake of plastic bags. || If you can't avoid the plastic bags, the best use is to use them until their useful life is over. Then dispose as you see fit.

Bear in mind, plastic is hardly ever actually recycled. || They are trash bags in my house. I have also taken some to the recycling drop off in the past, but our depleting supply has more recently compelled me to hold onto them so we always have trash bags handy. 

I don‚Äôt have any measures to consider which is more sustainable, but the recycling industry has long had my mistrust. Personally, I will continue to value them as ‚Äúfree‚Äù trash bags and feel okay that they‚Äôre at least getting a second life before meeting the dump. || Do you have pets?

If so, use them for pet waste (picking up poop, scooping the litter box, etc.)  Or give them to someone with a pet. || I use them as trash bags. I was returning them to stores to be recycled, but one of the stores stopped offering the service because the recycling company was actually just burning them üò≠ it made me a little suspicious of the other places claiming to recycle them, so I reuse them instead. || Plastic grocery bags aren‚Äôt actually recyclable, so throwing them out after they‚Äôre no longer usable would be the way to go (stores collect them to make people feel good, but sadly it‚Äôs a scam) || Return them to the store. I don't use plastic for trash. I ask for paper bags at the grocery and dollar store, which they always give free. Then I use them on top of my kitchen trash can (I know, weird).  I will use plastic from buying loaves of bread to hold yucky wet stuff and carry it outside to the big bin. The paper bags last a day or two since I have very little to throw out, except, ironically, the horrible plastic wrap on every item I buy. || I just reuse them for other things.

1. For trash can liners: I just reuse them until they tear/break down. Or they get thrown out if there's something gross (like cat vomit, for example) in there I feel I need to clean out the can and then replace the liner.  
2. I have cats, so I use them as poop bags. I can't do what some people do where they scoop the litter and flush it as the litter boxes are nowhere near the bathroom.. and I have septic tank in which you can't be putting the litter down the toilet (or much of anything else for that matter).  
3. If you have people you mail items to: use them as packaging. I trade books with people and use the bags as waterproof wrapping for transport. I also sometimes mail gifts and things to my relatives/friends and wad up the plastic bags as a protective barrier to keep things from jostling around.

I also don't like seeing them go to a landfill, but I feel that in much the same way that mail packaging will eventually end up there, so too will the plastic bags. It's why I try to reuse both as often as I can until they literally fall apart and can't be used anymore.

If you crochet, you could also make plarn and crochet with it. Some folks make more durable grocery bags with them.. or mats for people to lay/sit on. || Until I can find an alternative to plastic trash bags, I use the plastic grocery bags as trash can and litter box trash bags. || I use them for scooping the litter box. That is when I forget my reusable bags. I also use them to hold other recycling and then take them to the bins. || My hubs is Italian/American and some in his fathers family have been in the trash hauling business in NJ.  They could not fit the stereotype more! 

Uncle Joey confirmed that the trash bags were, indeed, trashed.  

There is just no easy way to undo the harm that has been done once the bag is produced.

I actually bought some  real kitchen trash bags this week.  I have had a box of them that I have had  since right before covid.  That is how seldom I use them.   But some circumstances have changed and I decided to get some more.  

I was so dissappointed that they are scented!  Bleh!   I will be using them in the garage and outside anyway. || If you are in the US and return them to a store, they aren't likely being recycled. They are being kept out of the landfill.

Plastic recycling is more expensive than it's worth, so they used to ship it all overseas, but that isn't so much the case anymore. || People with dogs or who foster dogs would probably love to take plastic bags off your hands to reuse || Try everything you can to not get them in the first place.

good period and curly hair products?,"I‚Äôm just starting to switch to sustainable products so i would love some advice and help! 
I am wondering if anyone can recommend me tampons that are zero waste/less harmful, i would prefer ones with applicators, also wondering opinions about diva cups i know they are great because removing single use period products but the comfort? 
i am also looking for a good leave in conditioner for my curls and maybe a frizz control product, no oils please 
thank you so much ","A good menstrual cup or disc won't feel like anything when it's in. There's thankfully a growing selection of body-safe, long-lasting cups now. You could try the Nixit, which is a disc and some swear by it. 

As for curly products, I used to use Professor Curl and Curliosity bars from ethique but they're hard to get now in Canada. If you have access to them, though, they're my favourite bar products so far for my hair (2c/3a). Just beware if you have hard water in your area, as they may not work the best then

Edit: as for post-wash control, I would take a slick of the Curliosity conditioner bar on my hand and run it through my hair after my final rinse. It's a very light version of a leave-in that way and it worked a treat for me. || [removed] || My Diva Cup is significantly more comfortable than a tampon. Can't recommend it enough. You know your body best. There are other shapes/sizes from different brands (I know some folks who swear by Luna -- which is a little shorter and rounder than a Diva Cup)

I will never never never go back to tampons. Cups are cleaner, more comfortable and more secure by a long shot. || For curly hair products I love Ecoslay. They are a small, black woman owned business. They offer refill pouches that may be recycled depending on if your recycling takes that type of packaging. I have 2c/3a curl type, course hair and I mainly use orange marmalade as a gel with a little rice pudding for leave in. I also use banana cream pie  deep conditioner and the chai shampoo if you wanted other recommendations. || You can flax seed gel at home. Once I tried it I never looked back. Here‚Äôs one recipe:¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/curlyhair/comments/17acw65/i_just_perfected_my_flaxseed_gel_recipe_and_im/

There‚Äôs a bunch on reddit but generally they‚Äôre pretty similar.¬† || i use organyc tampons with cardboard applicators. for hair, i‚Äôve been looking for a leave in for years. 

dip has a conditioner bar they say works as a leave in. i‚Äôm meh about it. 
tgin has petroleum free products. packaged in plastic. 
uncle funkys daughter has a great flaxseed marshmallow root gel. packaged in plastic. || I don‚Äôt use tampons anymore, but OB brand (in the US anyway) is the way for less waste, imo. They are applicator free, but i see there are reusable applicators in existence? You would just need to be extremely On It with hygiene. I was freaked out by the lack of applicator with OB, but it really wasn‚Äôt bad at all, I got used to it very quickly and then it was no big deal at all. I would say try it just once!

They used to make tampons with cardboard applicators‚Ä¶is that a thing still? Sounds uncomfy but significantly less plastic! 

Re: your concern about comfort with cups, I find them 1 million times more comfortable than any other option, for real. || I always found tampons brutally uncomfortable but I can wear a cup no problem! For me it‚Äôs the one zero waste swap I‚Äôd never go back from. It took me two tries to get the right one, so definitely measure first. I love reusable pads far more than the underwear, aisle¬†is expensive but the most comfy/absorbent I‚Äôve found.¬†

Curly hair: ecoslay rice pudding is the BEST but I also love consciously curly‚Äôs curl cream. I think it‚Äôs even more moisturizing than their leave in. I have heard good things about a simple planet hair products but I have yet to try that brand! For bars I like hibar or earthling co. and I‚Äôve tried a LOT. Both of those brands have conditioners that actually do something other than leave gunk on your hair. Hibar is gentler, but the earthling Co. ones are more of a traditional lather. || Menstrual discs are imo a great option! I find it‚Äôs easier to insert and remove than a cup, and they‚Äôre no messier for me because you can‚Äôt really remove a cup without some blood spilling out anyway. You can also empty the disc without taking it out. || For hair products I use:

- shampoo/conditioner bars from Kitsch. They have different versions targeted toward different needs. All the ones I‚Äôve tried have been great. 

- Mousse and cream from JVN. They are salon quality products that come in recyclable materials, mostly aluminum 

- Etee has a great deep conditioner that can be either a regular conditioner or a leave-in || I have a large Lena cup and use Glad Rags undyed panty liners cuz I‚Äôm old lol || I also say menstrual cups and period panties for while you adjust. Ethique‚Äôs curl shampoo and moisturizing conditioner are great. So is Lush‚Äôs Godiva shampoo bar.¬†

Curl products are tough if you want to look tidy and not greasy. Lush used to make ‚Äúqueen bee‚Äù which was a fragrant curl balm in a bar. I‚Äôm hoping for good suggestion here. Coconut oil makes a good balm for flyaways, but it‚Äôs no substitute for salon or even drugstore products.¬† || I love my Mooncup. I HATE it when I forget to take it with me and have to use a tampon, I would never go back to tampons or pads willingly! (I also like period undies when I‚Äôm extra lazy at home)

Ethique are my favourite solid shampoo and conditioner bars. Mine is wavy not full curl but I feel like they‚Äôre pretty good. || Hot take but I hated using the diva cup, it just wasn‚Äôt comfortable but I love period underwear. I have about 7 pairs now and they get me through a standard 3-4 day period with maybe an emergency disposable pad here and there, no more than 2. Ideally I‚Äôd have 2 more pairs and I‚Äôd be set. They‚Äôre so comfortable, they last long and honestly I feel like they work better than disposable pads! || Skip the cup and go straight to the disc‚Äî total game changer!! || I no longer have periods, so I don't use them anymore BUT when I did, I used a Pixie Cup, and I loved it!

What options are there for plastic-free cat food and litter?,"I've been buying Diamond Maintenance cat food for years, but when I went to restock last week I found out they'd switched to plastic packaging. Bummer! I know there are plenty of cat foods in paper bags, but I'm hoping to also upgrade to something higher quality while I'm at it. Without knowing much about what that \*really\* means, I'd like to avoid animal by-product, filler grains, etc. as much as possible. Organic (or even regeneratively raised/grown) would be a bonus. Preferably something I'm likely to find locally so I can avoid the fuel/packaging that comes with online orders. Any recommendations?

Similar question for litter. I'd been using corn-based litter like World's Best and Nature's Miracle because of the environmental impact of manufacturing clay litter, but I wasn't a fan of their plastic packaging. I've switched to Cedarific which comes in a paper bag, is very lightweight, and smells really nice (assuming you keep up with scooping/topping off regularly). But are there any options for non-clay, \*clumping\* litter that comes in a paper bag? It's not an absolute requirement but if I could find something that checks all my boxes, that'd be great.

Thanks!","i like oko cat for litter. it‚Äôs made from wood, is clumping, and comes in a paper bag that‚Äôs recyclable. i like to use the ultra fine version (pink bag)! || There are lots of reasons to buy locally (support a bricks and mortar store, no extra fuel use, etc.), but if you do end up ordering online, Chewy does its best to use mostly paper packaging, with very little plastic. It's a better option than the Nameless Beast. || When I had a cat I used to make her food.  It was amazing because her poops didn‚Äôt stink (regardless of wet or dry food and the brand).

I got the recipe from a vet and would blend up a big batch and freeze containers of it.  You basically throw meat, liver, egg and vitamins into a blender and puree.  (Please note if you want to do this get a real recipe, it‚Äôs been ten years and I don‚Äôt have mine any longer).

Mine was super fussy about litter so not really any help there. || We use the refillable cat litter from Petco. It‚Äôs not entirely plastic free because the tubs are plastic. We‚Äôve been using the same tub for refills for 6 years and there‚Äôs no signs that it‚Äôs breaking or will need to be replaced anytime soon.¬† || I don't have a cat anymore, but when I did, we used pine horse bedding rather than litter. It does come in a plastic coated bag, but you buy it 40lbs at a time and 40lbs of pine bedding is VERY different from 40lbs of clay litter. It lasts months! I probably bought four bags a year for one cat.

I personally believe that we should start bringing all of this packaging back to the stores we shop at, and put it in their trash cans. When their waste removal bills shoot up, they will start to pressure the manufacturers to use less wasteful packaging. We can't send it directly back to the manufacturer, so leveraging the retail stores as the middle people in all of this is our best shot right now. || World's Best used to come in a heavy paper bag, and I've written to them twice to ask them to go back to that. It's by far the best litter I know (I do a lot of rescue fostering, and litter is a constant in my life), so I continue to use it. I assuage my conscience by using the empty sacks as trash bin liners, since my apartment building requires us to put our trash in plastic bags anyway. (Grr.) || I feed my cat Purina Complete, I know it‚Äôs not the best in the world but it‚Äôs what the shelter fed her and my vet says it‚Äôs a great choice, if you get a bag under 10 pounds it‚Äôs in paper. || My cat needs special food, so we really don't have a choice in the matter. The wet food comes in cans at least. The dry food I buy in the biggest package I can, hoping it's a little better than buying multiple smaller ones. || I can second Oko for the litter, it's great! Otherwise, I make my own cat food in batch with TCFeline premix (there's other brands too depending on where you are), and then freeze it, it's super easy, especially if you buy ground meats! Feel free to dm if you want more info || [deleted] || Cat litter is just clay.  You can ""recharge"" it in a kiln after removing bulk detritus.  This will turn most of the remaining polymerized organo-nitrogen materials into a vapor.  Any temps between 100-500C will accomplish appreciable results. || Make your own cat food.

Gift ideas for non-zero waste friends,"What brands or items do you like to gift to people who aren‚Äôt in the zero waste/sustainability/clean beauty bubble? 

I want my dollars to be supporting brands and creators I like, but also want to get something my friend will actually use and enjoy. I feel so out of touch with mainstream stuff now, I don‚Äôt know what people want üôà 

I asked her for ideas and she just said she would love anything I get her. I know she goes to the gym a lot and likes fashion and beauty, but she doesn‚Äôt seem to have a lot of other hobbies in this season of life.

I‚Äôd love to know what you all do in this situation <3
","restaurant gift card, massage gift card, airbnb experience (one where you can change the date if it doesn't work out), nice bottle of wine if she drinks? || i find the best gifts for low waste are paying for dinner or an experience that you can do together. || 1. Thrift a cute photo frame and print a photo of the two of you 
2. Decorate and write a thoughtful card
3. Gift experiences - like a pottery class, tickets to a show, restaurant gift cards, mani-pedis, etc.
4. Make something from scratch - like baked goods, knit a scarf, etc. 
5. Houseplants that you‚Äôve grown from your own plant cuttings
6. Buy consumable gifts like desserts, chocolates, wine, from local brands || Give them something THEY want.  A so-called sustainable gift that is not their style or taste will collect dust, go to a thrift store, or go to landfill.  

Speaking personally, I HATE the sustainable aesthetic.  It's very plain, bland, and beige.  Aka not me in any way, shape, or form.  And I stick to my tried and true beauty products ('clean' beauty often lacks the preservatives that give products a longer shelf life).  

If you want to get her something sustainable, give her an experience. || Whether the friend is zero-waste or not, most of my friends are decluttering, so I‚Äôm always conscious about not creating clutter when I give gifts.

I rarely give physical objects unless they are consumables, like food, wine, pretty notecards, or cut flowers. Often I do things like take the person out to dinner or to an event, or give a gift certificate for a treat like a massage.

I do give books from time to time because I consider these semi-consumables - that is, the person can read it and then gift or donate it if they don‚Äôt have space.

The only time I give physical objects intended to stay around is when I am pretty certain the person wants it from things they‚Äôve said to me.

ETA: I haven‚Äôt formally adopted a ‚Äúzero-waste‚Äù philosophy, but I hate putting things in landfills, especially anything that could be useful to someone. So I use Buy Nothing and Goodwill a lot when I‚Äôm getting rid of stuff.

I also hate excessive consumerism (for example, I visit family at Thanksgiving instead of Christmas because I can‚Äôt stand the overboard gift exchanges they engage in, and don‚Äôt want to be a part of it). So sounds like I‚Äôm at least partially there already? :-) Will follow this sub to learn more. || Consumables or an event/experience. || I make baskets or flower vase covers. Then I cut flowers from my garden. That's my go-to in the summer. In winter, I make fudge and pack it in a thrifted tin or box. || You could get her a gift card to the gym she usually goes to so she could put it towards her monthly membership fee, or add on services (like 1:1 training, or massages) at the gym. You could gift her a manicure, facial, massage, or whatever she likes to get, or just take her out for dinner. 

In any case the gift is for the recipient - if there are zero waste beauty products you think she would like and you want her to try out, that's certainly an option, but I know I am pretty selective about what I introduce into my skincare/beauty regimen so if she is already really into it she probably has some opinions about what she would want to add in. || I would avoid makeup/beauty/body products in general. They‚Äôre *so* specific to the person and how they interact with their particular skin and body. Like I found relief from a lot of my skin allergies in vegan products, I don‚Äôt know what exactly I was reacting to but it was likely a non-vegan colorant or preservative or something that isn‚Äôt used in vegan products. My friend however cannot use many vegan products, he‚Äôs got a really bad ragweed allergy and ragweed relatives are often used in plant-based products. Like chamomile so soothing right? Nope, gives him hives. And it‚Äôs one of those things that you just don‚Äôt know until you try.

Personally I‚Äôd either gift another of a consumable product she already has and uses so you can be sure it won‚Äôt go to waste, or gift an experience. Like is there a concert you‚Äôd both like to go to? A movie she‚Äôs talked about wanting to go see? A restaurant she‚Äôs mentioned wanting to go to? || Membership to a local experience for a year (Zoo, Botanical Garden, etc) in their interest! It‚Äôs my go to gift and I‚Äôve always been told it‚Äôs a great one || Whatever you can get from a local farm or farmers market. My local farm sells herbs, bouquets, meat, eggs, fresh and dried flowers and veggies. Small and local she‚Äôll love. || Love the comments about spending time together instead. 

As a gift giver though I‚Äôve gifted home made body scrubs in glass, solid hair mask, reusable paper towels, reusable straws and thrifted finds ü§ç || I do love Lush Cosmetics || If your friend is into fashion, handmade jewelry or accessories are a fun gift. I've also made gifts of upcycled or rehabilitated vintage items, like leather wallets or bags that I've cleaned up and brought back to life. || Thrift something you think they'd like! || In addition to the other great ideas people have left, here are a few of mine:

\- if she's into skin care, i think that (depending on your budget) you could make a small basket for an ""at-home spa night""! soap and a bath bomb/shower steamer from a local farmer's market with some homemade sugar scrub in a cute woven basket can be really adorable, and you could definitely add/substitute based on $ and preferences/allergies etc

\- a mini self-date night ! thrift a book/movie that you think she would enjoy (preferably one that you've seen but she hasn't) and wrap the book/movie in butcher's paper with a fun-but-vague description (look up ""[blind date with a book](https://blinddatewithabook.net/how-to-write-your-own-blind-date-with-a-book-teasers)/movie"" if you need ideas), then add some popcorn (movie) or tea/coffee (book) and her favorite chocolates. maybe even set a date to watch together if it's a move!

\- if you're a bit more artsy, you could try embroidering her initial or birth month flower on to some cloth napkins. these are a nice gift that is useable while feeling a bit elevated, especially if she enjoys hosting at her place.

\- in a similar vein, if she drinks alcohol you might be able to make DIY cocktail kits? [here is one idea that i found](https://www.crowdedkitchen.com/diy-cocktail-kits/), though you could definitely customize to better suit her tastes

\- lastly, you mentioned that she doesn't seem to have a lot of hobbies right now. that tends to happen to me when i'm swamped in other areas of my life. similar to getting gift cards to a restaurant, maybe look into a house cleaning gift certificate (or enlist an army of friends!) or laundry service or other chore, to give her the time to explore new hobbies or re-discover old ones. sometimes, time can be what we need most! || A cyber gift: Apple gift card. || Services like massage/nail/sauna/facial. || if she wears rings, you could get her one of those ring covers that people use so they don‚Äôt damage their rings/harm themselves while working out || Email them a gift card to an experience",30,ZeroWaste,2025-08-06 20:57:22,gift ideas non zero waste friends,brands items like gift

Better lighting?,"I have a bag full of failed leds each of which died in months to a year, they never last the 5-10 years they claim. They're not recyclable where I am, they're made of plastic and contain lead and arsenic. The few places that recycle light bulbs only recycle CFLs (not the tubes which I think have much more mercury than cfls?).

Worse are the fixtures that don't have replaceable parts and the whole thing gets thrown in the trash when it fails.

Is there more responsible lighting that produces less waste and is recyclable?","LED strip lighting, either rigid ruler-sized hard modules or flexible reels you install into aluminum housings.

Both of those types if an LED fails you can just remove the failed section (even the flexible strips can be cut at specific points every dozen or so LED elements) and put in a replacement piece. There's solderless 'click shut' style connectors for the flexible LED strips, no soldering needed even there.

For 'bulb' form factors they're such an enormous compromise that no, there's no long-term-responsible LED products for that, it's a form factor that's almost anathema to LED lifespan. || First: LEDs are the best light source we have, but implementations vary. I don‚Äôt think you need to consider any other light source.

The last time I brought a (LED)light bulb, I brought one for \~15‚Ç¨ with a rated 50.000h lifespan While the 15.000h would have only cost 3‚Ç¨. But I was in the store they only had one long life bulb in the size I needed and just fed up with having to buy a bulb, when LEDs are supposed to last ‚Äúforever‚Äù. The prices don‚Äôt add up yet.

The bulb form factor isn‚Äôt made for LEDs, but that‚Äôs the lights I have. And at least I can replace the Light part without soldering. Many of the other lights just seem to be even more cheaply made. And don‚Äôt come with information about their life span.

My ‚Äúsolution‚Äù would be to demand better regulation. Electronics recycling, lead free electronics, and life spans aren‚Äôt something you can solve as an individual or in the free market. Do you have general ‚Äúelectronics recycling‚Äù? That‚Äôs where I bring my old bulbs, if they really are recycled is a different story. ¬†

a minor and my parents don‚Äôt care much about the environment. what to do?,"I‚Äôm in hs and my parents don‚Äôt care much about the environment. I‚Äôm extremely passionate about saving the earth but it‚Äôs hard to be zero-waste when i don‚Äôt have control. Like i cant buy plastic free things for the house, or get a heat pump or get vegan groceries. Help!","Hello! While we are happy to host this conversation, if anyone is interested in more talk about veganism and zero waste, you should also check out /r/PlantBased4ThePlanet and /r/ZeroWasteVegans!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/ZeroWaste) if you have any questions or concerns.* || You can't control others.

What you can do is participate in community based environmental activies.  Assuming you're in school, your school likely has an enviornmental club.  Join it.  Suggest activities like removing plastic bottles from the school cafeteria or doing a cleanup at a local park. || You recycle and compost and thrift.

You don't have to buy expensive things to be zero waste. Remember - a heat pump is like a major major house expense that many can't just afford on a whim. For the pump, duct work and labor - it's like comparable to a year of college tuition.

You can always reuse, fix, recycle, compost and thrift. That's all things you can easily start with.

There are also plenty of things you can also do to reduce your electrical and water consumption around the house like collecting clean gray water and using it to water the outdoor plants.

Zero waste doesn't need to be about spending $$$$$$.

And please - don't pressure your parents into spending $$$$$$$$$ on things like a heat pump. If their furnace isn't dead - remember reuse and fixing is important too and there's really no reason to spend all that money on a home upgrade you don't need when what you have works just fine.

If you want to help your parents with energy efficient upgrades, you can seal cracks and drafts around windows and doors with caulking (cheap), and also look into installing ultra touch denim insulation in the attic and radiant barrier in the attic. All those jobs can be done by a high school student's labor (so you can do the job yourself) and the material costs are pretty affordable (so your parents might pay for the materials), and all actually do make a huge difference. || I don't know what it's like where you are, but where I live, community volunteer hours are mandatory for high school students. Lots of organisations that are environmental, especially during summer months, are looking for volunteers and have lots of teens who show up. If it's things like community gardening, you can reduce waste by bringing home produce from the gardens. You can also do things like use tote bags instead of plastic bags on your own or reuse old clothing as rags, for crafts etc.. 

Lots of the advice you see is aimed at adults, so don't guilt yourself for not being able to follow advice that wasn't developed with you in mind. There will be plenty of time for that when you are an adult. || Lead by example where you can as well.¬†
I remember my parents were NOT into the green bin ( compost) when it was introduced to our city.¬†
I bought a few green containers from Dollarama and wrote on them in sharpie what was meant to be green bin stuff, and put them in the rooms that had garbage bins - they are still using the same bins and are consistent green bin people now even though they thought I was being extremely extra at the time || Don‚Äôt fall victim to greenwashing. If parents‚Äô heating and cooling systems in their home is working, then there‚Äôs no reason to replace it. You don‚Äôt need to spend money on food that‚Äôs ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù 
Be aware of the selling points and buzz words. The produce section of your local grocery store is probably more ‚Äúenvironmentally friendly‚Äù than the prepackaged, highly processed food that has all the feel good propaganda printed on the label || There are other ways you can reduce waste! 


Reusable water bottles 


Limit buying clothes and shoes, or buy second hand, or learn how to mend your clothes 


Eat more produce and less processed foods (if you eat less than your parents won‚Äôt buy as much. Might take a couple months for them to adjust their spending). 


Ask for zero waste items for birthday gifts, like shampoo bars. 


Join Buy Nothing group on facebook, where locals in your neighborhood give away stuff for free. By getting things second hand you can extend the life of stuff. 


Zero waste also means using what you do have! So having plastic stuff in your house is okay as long as you keep using it. || Organize people to vote and take direct action, as far left as possible. Nothing you can do in your personal life can put a dent of any significance. We can fight for wins together, or we can just keep losing || A regular A/C unit is also a heat pump, except in the winter time.  

You can offer to cook a meal once in a while, and substitute lower impact ingredients.  

You can offer to wash the dishes, and run any appliances when the sun is shining.  The delay timer is quite useful for this.  My flatmates know I will be cross if they turn on the dishwasher during peak residential demand, which is right after commuters get home.  Most household electric bills are expected to go up by $400 this year in my region.  Not too hard to convince anyone paying a bill that incentivizing the utility to invest in solar is a reliable source of return on investment.  

You can also thrift clothing and learn to tailor your own reclaimed garments.  Dads are usually quite enthusiastic about complementary sweaters, and they are invariably on board with prudent use of the thermostat.  

If you have a watt meter, usually about $10 new, it's usually interesting to analyze individual appliances to see how they fit into the consumption picture.  For example, my window A/C unit draws the same amount of power as eight portable fans or TVs, while the toaster draws about four times as much again.  The laptop, phone charger and router combined draw less than a fan. || You can focus on your education! The world needs well educated people passionate about the environment.

Think global, act local. Volunteering in your community can have huge impacts on it and yourself. You could think about getting into local politics, see what areas are open to minors there. That tends to be an area where passionate people who put in the work can have an impact.

You can try to organize ride shares with your peers, so your parents don‚Äôt need to individually drive you everywhere. Another commentor suggested cooking for the family. I suggest focusing on action like that: that have an additional benefit, since eco-friendliness isn‚Äôt persuasive for your parents.

You can‚Äôt solve all this world problems on your own. Remember to be kind to yourself and have some fun. || Set an example. You can't tell people to change, but you can set an example. This is especially true as a minor trying to change your parents' behavior. You can't. || To mirror some other comments, you can only control what you can control.

The biggest thing that helps combat waste is simply using, buying, and consuming less stuff in the first place. Since you're a kid, you already aren't consuming much by choice. Being okay with your ""old"" phone, ""old"" clothes, existing toys and gadgets instead of buying new ones all the time is a great way to cut down on waste. So if for instance, you're asked what you want for your birthday or Christmas, make sure everything you ask for is second-hand, plastic-free, or reusable, etc. (One of my favorite gifts is a gift card to Poshmark.) || I would try to play the money saving aspect, like if we switched to reusable blah blah we could save however much a year. The simple environmentalist on youtube has a lot of great videos about how much money can be saved by being zero waste || I just started making changes for myself, like using refillable hair & bodycare, utilizing reusables for myself for things like lunch at work/school, and other little things. Then one day I was running errands with my dad and one of my errands legit was to refill my shampoo. It kind of sparked his interest, and then I showed him some of the kitchen stuff and said that we had the dish brush at work and I loved using it because it cleaned so well. He bought one! Then when I moved out, I was able to get a lot of the stuff I wanted to have in my apartment at the same time my brother was also making these swaps. Every time my parents visited, they got to experience the things we were using and that they were genuinely better than the products they were using. I never brought up the benefits for the environment, just the benefits for me, and I‚Äôll be darned if they haven‚Äôt started using a lot of the same products. Then my mom asked me about the environmental impact of some of the most common household items, and we had a great conversation, and before I knew it, they had moved almost all of their investments into more planet-friendly options. This has been a 10+ year process to get them there. They‚Äôll never be perfectly zero-waste, but neither will I, and that‚Äôs okay! Try just leading by example where you can and when they ask questions, just go in gently with the new information. || Learn what you can and do what you can. Seek out like minded friends. And in time you will be able to make more decisions for yourself. Good on you! || even reusing things, refusing straws, or being the reason your family recycles more can ripple out || Go to the other end.

Plant trees. Volunteer in other ways. Get involved in community education. || My parents were the same. You can't change them, you do what you can in your home. For example when my hometown started recycling, they wouldn't use a separate bin, so I took the recyclables out of the trash and put them in the correct bin. When my sibling decided to go vegetarian, my parents gave her a hard time, but she stuck to her boundaries. You have to stick up for yourself. She later transitioned to vegan. You can buy your own clothes, foods, plastic free toiletries/items.

Later in life my father decided to go vegan himself. So I guess when you set an example, sometimes others follow.

You can focus on creating community for yourself of like minded people, finding other environmentalists, vegans etc; either making new friends, meeting up with community groups etc. || You may be able to gently nudge them by showing how it‚Äôll save them money. You don‚Äôt even need to mention that it‚Äôs for the environment. ‚ÄúYou can save $X per month by changing from A to B. I can help set that up for you, if you want.‚Äù

But you can only control yourself, so start with that. You aren‚Äôt the one making your household decisions yet, but you can make changes in your own life. || Tbh I often find older folks do many things that are helpful for the environment without considering it environmentally friendly. Ex. Using something until it's worn out, minimizing unnecessary driving. Or things that are cheaper. Phrasing it this way, might help. 

Also, like, buying heat pumps isn't the only way to care for the environment. You don't even say what heating source your parents house currently uses, so how much better heat pumps would be isn't obvious. Especially if their current heat source still works.

""Vegan groceries"" like locally grown veg are obviously good,  but vegan meat substitutes aren't as good (though often better than meat!). But it all depends so much on where you are sourcing things and how you are getting them. 

""Buying plastic free items"" can make sense when something breaks and is irreparable or no longer fits. For example, seeking out a sustainably and ethically made sneaker after yours are completely trashed might make sense. Going out and buying a bunch of plastic free stuff to replace things you already have that work perfectly fine isn't environmentally friendly.",62,ZeroWaste,2025-08-06 04:38:16,minor parents care much

Blueland Laundry Tablets,"Hi everyone,

I'm wondering what washer settings you use when you're using the blueland laundry tablets and oxi boost?
I have an 8yo HE top load washer without an agitator and I typically put the tablet and oxi boost in first. 
I just feel like our clothes aren't coming out clean. My 3yo had blue chalk on a white dress and it didn't even come out. 

I've been trying to play around with different settings and temperatures but I'm still not impressed. I've been using this stuff for years, but lately I've been second guessing it. 

Thanks in advance!","Change your laundry detergent to anything but Blueland and you will notice results right away. It's not worth it to do all this extra work to get it to perform. || We use powder tide and everything comes out. My kids clothes are constantly stained and we don‚Äôt even have to pretreat most things, the stains just come right out in the wash. It comes in a cardboard box, so the only plastic is the scoop and the box handle, which I‚Äôm fine with. || Try Nellies washing soda (it's actually detergent not just soda) comes in a tin, and you need 1tbs per load, excellent product. (costco also sells giant buckets online) || i use nellie‚Äôs‚Äîi won‚Äôt support blue land || I would grab a small tub and soak the dress in OxiClean first. Then throw in the wash. In my extended family, we don‚Äôt use Blueland. Both my mom and I use Clean People, but we also use vinegar as our softener or mixed with our softener. 

We always put our wash cycles on delicate (me) or normal (mom) and set everything on cold water (except bedding and towels). My mom has been operating this way for years, and she learned from her mom who was a nurse. || Just wanted to come and say don‚Äôt try seventh generation either. Was in a pinch when my local refill store was closed and bought it. Omg our clothes smelled ü§¢ || I used to use Blueland but stopped because my clothes always had white chalky streaks on them. Then I started buying All powdered detergent from Walmart. Then they stopped carrying it. Now I order Arm & Hammer powder from Amazon and they ship it as it comes with no extra packaging. || I love Dirty labs laundry concentrate. It works really well and comes in recyclable aluminum bottles. I also use vinegar in the fabric softener spot. I can‚Äôt speak to your type of machine, but this is what I use in my front loader and it works great! || I follow this guy on TikTok who reviews laundry detergent, and BlueLand preformed really badly. He recommends Tide Evo (the fiber sheets) or Tide Powder || Same problems. I try to letthe drum fill slightly before adding the tablet, but this only works if your machine allows. Sometimes the tablet dissolves unevenly if it just sits at the bottom dry. || I stopped using those because they didn‚Äôt dissolve. I always use cold water and delicate. I think they‚Äôre designed for warm water maybe. To use them up, I broke them into fourths so they would be more likely to dissolve. || Interesting. About 3 months ago we stopped using Blueland laundry and dishwasher soap because it seemed to be ineffective. I wonder if they changed something in their soaps. Glad to know I wasn't making it up. || Nellies or Meloria are your most effective zero
detergents || You can try pretreating with something like sal suds or a laundry bar.

Also a lot of manufacturers changed their formulas late last year, early this year for profit reasons, so your detergent may have worked better in the past.

I'm not familiar with blueline, I use liquid detergents and use less than the manufacturer calls for, but enough to get things clean. With laundry detergents in general, if you're using too much, or if you're using things like fabric softener, you can wind up with residue in your machine and clothes and they won't come out as clean. You would need to clean your machine, and ""strip"" your clothes to get the build up off, and then wash normally, they should start to come out cleaner. It's also possible that blueline changed the formula (or manufacturer) so its weaker or less effective. If it's weaker you'd have to use more, if it's less effective, you would have to change what you're using to clean your clothes. 

I check review sites, like consumer reports, for detergent cleaning quality etc. And I have to also check for ingredients since I'm allergic to a lot of things.

I'm not sure what your detergent is made of, some use a booster like washing soda, but that can also cause dyes to release and fade your clothes. || Results may vary but I like my Laundry Egg! I supplement really dirty oily rags with a little washing soda, borax or oxi clean if something is really funky. All of them come in cardboard. üëç || I actually have tons of blueland tabs sitting in a cabinet from a few years ago (well, I bought them during the pandemic, so more than a few I guess.)  That stuff does not work.  This is my absolutely fav: [Laundry Powder Detergent - 128 HE (64 Standard) Loads - Plastic-Free ‚Äî Meliora Cleaning Products](https://meliorameansbetter.com/products/laundry-powder-detergent?utm_source=microsoft&utm_medium=paid-search&utm_campaign=branded&utm_content=lp&msclkid=c9931e574d461a8c609276cffb75bab1&utm_term=meliora+laundry+detergent). I just buy the refill containers when they are on sale and use it right out of the box. This stuff is great. || Have had the same issue with two of my soap dispenser bottles breaking within months and their laundry tablets always get stuck on the rubber gasket. This happen to anyone else? Dishwasher tablets seem to work fine. Probably won't re-order though. I like Rosey brand a bit better. || I use these products and also have a front load he washer. I wash everything in cold water except for towels and sheets. I throw two tablets in with the clothes and put the booster powder in the little dispenser drawer. Always seems to work well for me. || There are lots of other comments on here about what to use, so I‚Äôll just add my 2 cents about Blueland. Blueland washer tablets (at least the ones I have) are meant to be placed on top of your dirty laundry, so that the water hits it first to create the ‚Äúsoap‚Äù prior to filter down and washing your clothes. 

If I don‚Äôt put ours on top of the clothes, or they fall against the door or down into the clothes‚Ä¶.I will find a full tablet and still dirty clothes at the end of the cycle. I always wash on tap cold and Eco/Normal. It‚Äôs one of my next switches to change laundry detergents from Blueland tabs, but for now they work. || Blueland has worked great for us, better than other natural and PVA-free options, but we usually use Normal or Permanent Press cycles, which are warm.

What to do with current nylon/polyester clothing.,"It's the big question isnt it. And while a majority of my clothing is cotton there's a decent amount that isnt.
For example. I just found out that 2 sets of my PJs- one of which I am wearing is fully polyester. 

For context I went down the big plastics rabbit hole after my radio iodine therapy last year. Just the amount of plastic that was around me in hospital to protect everyone else from my radioactive body. It made me feel really bad to be honest. A bit like ah- I was contributing to waste to stay alive. I know that's awful. But after that it really pushed me to start being more concious about what I buy. I look at tags every time I go out now heck I even converted all of my make up to polymer and silicone free make up this year!!(that was a whole rabbit hole too!!)

But clothes. Ah. It's hard. I bought so much of it after highschool when I had no school uniform anymore and kind of just... didn't think like the teen I was. And now especially after looking into the effects of microplastics on health... and now having a weakened endocrine system after thyroid cancer... it scares me.

I know plastic is unavoidable. I've rationalised because guess what my medication comes in- plastic. And it's a life long medication so... I can't avoid it. 

But I made 2 big goals this year: only buy 90+% natural fibre clothes and only polymer free make up (ingredients wise. So that it doesnt get washed down the drain) 

But current clothes RAH that I'm still conflicted. Wear or not wear? ","I think not wearing things that already exist is wasteful, so if you already have it or buy it secondhand and you like wearing it, wear it. Good job on your make up switchover!

Edit: I don‚Äôt know enough about the medical side, but ‚Äúif you like wearing it‚Äù includes it not negatively affecting your physical and mental health‚Ä¶ donate things you don‚Äôt like wearing, for sure.¬† || Once my polyester clothes are no longer wearable, I like to use them to stuff pillows/plushies/poufs! I know donating them is usually futile so I try to reuse in a way that‚Äôll minimize microplastic shedding, to the best of my ability || It‚Äôs the least wasteful to wear them for the whole life of the garments (or do a clothing swap or something where they‚Äôll continue to be in use by your friends), since buying new ‚Äì even the most sustainable options ‚Äì are still using resources to produce. I know it can be nice to have things feel ‚Äúperfect‚Äù, though, so absolutely work towards creating the sustainable closet of your dreams over time! But in the meantime, wear what you have and love üíï You can also look into getting one of the Guppy Friend bags to help keep the microplastics that shed in the wash out of waterways, if that‚Äôs something you feel strongly about. || I take a lot of medicine too. See if your prescriber will give you a 90 day supply. That way it‚Äôs just one plastic bottle instead of 3. Also, if it‚Äôs thyroid replacement therapy then don‚Äôt start skipping doses. Low sodium is no joke, it don‚Äôt play! Also, my prayers are with you and good luck with your recovery! || Try reselling anything in great condition or donating to a women‚Äôs shelter.

Side note: I know in this sub we say it‚Äôs wasteful to get rid of things or throw them away before using. Don‚Äôt let that stop you in your case from making your changes. At the end of the day your health comes first. I understand the fears after thyroid cancer, I think if people were in the same position they would also be in hyperdrive getting rid of any potential endocrine disruptors. Do what will give you a peace of mind, and congrats on beating cancer. You‚Äôre making the right steps¬† || If it‚Äôs just a prescription bottle, those can be cleaned and reused.

Clothing- I‚Äôve decided to wear what I have and keep what still fits, but slowly transition to alternatives. You do what you feel is right. People still wear it, so you can donate it if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with it. Look at fabrics in your home- definitely ditch the pj‚Äôs, but check sheets, blankets and carpets, too. Coats or second layers are probably ok as they don‚Äôt need to be cleaned as often. || You wear it. It‚Äôs already been made and purchased, wear the clothes until they‚Äôre worn out entirely then replace with natural fibers. Otherwise you‚Äôre just creating more plastic trash || I‚Äôve sold almost all of my synthetic fabric clothing on Depop and Poshmark. Keeping winter and rain coats along with some warm socks my mother gifted me || the fact that you‚Äôre asking these questions matters. Millions of  tons of textile waste are created each YEAR and a big chunk of that is synthetics like polyester that take hundreds of years to break down, shedding microplastics the whole time. || Depends on ur waste and plastic consumption goals. I try to be less wasteful, but if it comes to plastic I avoid it.¬†


For a no plastic approach: get rid of them. Try donating them or giving them to family members.


For a zero waste approach: keep it as long as possible, reuse it, upcycle it, etc.¬†


But in all honestly, I would just get rid of it considering you said you have a weakened endocrine system. Plastic clothing contributes majorly to that. Wish you well. || I'm also split on this. I've heard plastic fibers shed microplastics in the wash. For daily wear, I'm trying to wear natural materials more often so I wash the nylon and polyester less. The plastic fibers are nice for activewear though. And with how long they've lasted (I've got some 20-year-old nylon socks) I'm starting to think the shedding is overblown. Surely tires are the bigger culprit.

For future purchases, I aim for natural materials for underwear, base layers, and shirts/pants. Rain/snow outerwear doesn't get washed often (if ever). PFAS is its own issue but there's a Veritasium vid outlining the type of PFAS that's most problematic. The process for waterproofing clothing is worse than anything the clothing sheds. As long as you don't re-waterproof things at home with a PFAS spray, the clothing itself is pretty harmless. || It doesn't sound zero waste to get rid of garments you wear to replace them with something else that was recently manufactured.",18,ZeroWaste,2025-08-03 18:04:58,current nylon polyester clothing,big question isnt majority clothing cotton decent amount isnt example found sets pjs one wearing fully polyester context went big plastics rabbit hole radio iodine therapy last year amount plastic around hospital protect everyone else radioactive body made feel really bad honest bit like ah contributing waste stay alive know awful really pushed start concious buy look tags every time go heck even converted make polymer silicone free make year whole rabbit hole clothes ah hard bought much highschool school uniform anymore kind think like teen especially looking effects microplastics health weakened endocrine system thyroid cancer scares know plastic unavoidable rationalised guess medication comes plastic life long medication avoid made big goals year buy natural fibre clothes polymer free make ingredients wise doesnt get washed drain current clothes rah still conflicted wear wear,think wearing things already exist wasteful already buy secondhand like wearing wear good job make switchover edit know enough medical side like wearing includes negatively affecting physical mental health donate things like wearing sure polyester clothes longer wearable like use stuff pillows plushies poufs know donating usually futile try reuse way minimize microplastic shedding best ability least wasteful wear whole life garments clothing swap something continue use friends since buying new even sustainable options still using resources produce know nice things feel perfect though absolutely work towards creating sustainable closet dreams time meantime wear love also look getting one guppy friend bags help keep microplastics shed wash waterways something feel strongly take lot medicine see prescriber give day supply way one plastic bottle instead also thyroid replacement therapy start skipping doses low sodium joke play also prayers good luck recovery try reselling anything great condition donating women shelter side note know sub say wasteful get rid things throw away using let stop case making changes end day health comes first understand fears thyroid cancer think people position would also hyperdrive getting rid potential endocrine disruptors give peace mind congrats beating cancer making right steps prescription bottle cleaned reused check matthew ministeries details clothing decided wear keep still fits slowly transition alternatives feel right people still wear donate feel comfortable look fabrics home definitely ditch pj check sheets blankets carpets coats second layers probably ok need cleaned often wear already made purchased wear clothes worn entirely replace natural fibers otherwise creating plastic trash sold almost synthetic fabric clothing depop poshmark keeping winter rain coats along warm socks mother gifted fact asking questions matters millions tons textile waste created year big chunk synthetics like polyester take hundreds years break shedding microplastics whole time depends ur waste plastic consumption goals try less wasteful comes plastic avoid plastic approach get rid try donating giving family members zero waste approach keep long possible reuse upcycle etc honestly would get rid considering said weakened endocrine system plastic clothing contributes majorly wish well also split heard plastic fibers shed microplastics wash daily wear trying wear natural materials often wash nylon polyester less plastic fibers nice activewear though long lasted got year old nylon socks starting think shedding overblown surely tires bigger culprit future purchases aim natural materials underwear base layers shirts pants rain snow outerwear get washed often ever pfas issue veritasium vid outlining type pfas problematic process waterproofing clothing worse anything clothing sheds long waterproof things home pfas spray clothing pretty harmless sound zero waste get rid garments wear replace something else recently manufactured

Any recommendations for biodegradable or compostable glue?,"Hello reader, I am looking towards making crafts with paper mache and cotton threads. 

Since I prefer to minimise introducing more plastic and microplastic into our land and waters, I would like to know if there are any good biodegradable and or compostable hot melts and superglue alternatives that you recommend!

Tldr: are there any compostable and or biodegradable strong glue alternatives (hot melts / hot glue / superglue) you recommend?","Pine sap makes a good traditional glue. || How permanent does the glue need to be? Smashed sticky rice makes paste in a pinch but it's sensitive to moisture and pests. Also often dries a little lumpy. || Wheat paste? I do bookbinding and that's been plenty strong for me as long as you let it dry properly.

As for something like hot glue maybe a wax? Or something like pitch or tree resin? You might just be better off using a different attachment method though, hot glue is kinda unique. || You can look into fish glue. It's used a lot for canvases. || There is no hot glue that is going  to fit that requirement.  What are you using to bind your paper mache?

In Italy there exists the art of sculpting and creating forms from paper made of either linen or cotton.  They are made to last and it is an old art form.   Here is a link to it. And also the old Venetian carnival masks were made of paper mache, too.  You might look into what they use as this is from before any modern glues that they were doing this.   

If you are wanting to use glues that are biodegradable, they are going to begin to do just that in a hot and humid place.   Anything organic like that will degrade.   That is just the truth.   It cant be biodegradable and not biodegrade in due time.   It cant be both ways.

I had been buying Wild shower gel, lip balm and deodorant via subscription until about a year ago when it became apparent that I owned about 30 unopened bottles of shower gel alone.¬†

The shower gel - I have literally superglued the pump part to the case. You can still open the case via the mod section to pour something else in. Refilling the insert bottles lasted 3-6 months.

Number one zero waste swap for a beginner?,"I love this subreddit and I'm slowly organically making swaps as they come up and I remember them. However, I tend to get really overwhelmed with the amount of swaps I can and should make so I'm wondering what is your number one swap that you'd recommened to start with. 

For context if it matters I am an Australian woman who doesn't wear makeup so those swaps don't really apply. I'd prefer local brands to avoid shipping miles where possible. Some swaps I've already made include carrying reusable shopping bags, naked fruits, reusing glass containers and looking for recyclables over single use where I can (plus I almost exclusively buy second hand (op shops) where I can).

I'm happy to answer any questions and thanks in advance for any input. I'm hoping this will help out some other newbies too.","You are doing great. The best sustainable swap is waiting. Your poly-blend socks wore out? Get some  cotton ones. Out of soap? Get a bar. Trying to swap too many things at once tends to lead to overconsumption (at least for me). || Going back to the reduce, reuse, recycle slogan, they're in that order for a reason. And the right beginner swap is the one that sticks, so it should be done on a personal basis.

I'd reccomend going through room by room or activity by activity and listing what are clear signs of waste you notice. Then choose from that list what seems doable to do a little better at. 

This could be switching from single use plastic water bottles to a water filter pitcher and a reusable one. Or it could be going from disposable menstral products to a menstral cup or  disc. Or cut out unnecessary online purchases by not saving credit card numbers or disabling apple pay so purchases take more thought.

But to avoid getting overwhelmed I'd pick one item to work on changing every 2-3 weeks or so, so that you don't stretch yourself too thin and that you give yourself time to adjust to the change without feeling like you lost all the conviences that come with not paying attention to the amount of waste you create || Whenever you want to buy something, see if you can get it secondhand from fb marketplace or a thrift shop, even eBay. I‚Äôve found a lot of stuff specifically marketed as ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù is overpriced and greenwashed, and it‚Äôs better to focus on using what already exists in the world. Some sanitizer and water and most things are perfectly good to use. 

Also, hang drying your clothing makes it last way longer, so even ‚Äúfast fashion‚Äù pieces can be worn for years. || A really easy swap I did in the beginning of my journey was never buying paper towels or napkins. I have a whole roll of cotton napkins I use instead. || Cut out polyester clothing. Natural fiber only. ¬†If you already have polyester clothes, wear them until they are in-wearable and eventually replace with natural fiber.¬†

Minimize eating out at quick bite or carry out places. Only restaurants that use silverware and wash plates and what not.¬†

Buy food that uses as minimal packaging as possible. Fruits and veggies without any packaging. If there is packaging (especially plastic), try to buy larger quantities to minimize impact.

I‚Äôm Aussie too and got mine from Kmart. || [deleted] || Hopefully you already know this, but just in case: Don't be eager to buy anything, especially to replace anything, or you just created more garbage. Do everything you can with what you have and only after running out or wearing out should you look at more sustainable alternatives to things you need to replace. A lot of things can be eliminated and don't even need swaps. || I bring metal utensils to work for my lunch instead of using plastic utensils from the office! I also use a cloth napkin for work and one for home. || My starter things:

* bamboo cutlery with cloth napkin, metal straw & cloth holder
* reusable bags of different types & sizes
* towel to dry hands, when out of the house
* reusable period pads
* wet dry bags. || Don't buy bin liners - we just reuse plastic bags that are still being handed out (2 adult household, not a lot of solid waste after recycling).¬†


Replace tampons/pads with a moon cup/disc (if you can). || One of my first swaps was not a swap at all. It was learning to mend and self-tailor. When the clothes fit your body and you can easily repair expected wear (a button pops off, a pin hole develops, etc), the urge to buy other, different clothes goes away. Or at least it did for me.

Some of my clothes are synthetic as they come, but are 30 years old, making them more Zero Waste than a greenwashed (and superwashed) merino shirt which is tossed after two years due to a lack of skill in caring for such a delicate fabric. || Shampoo bar and safety razor is a good way to start :)
Also, since you‚Äôre not in the US: Voting green is the single most impactful thing you can do. || I keep a metal spoon and fork in my bag & car. I found some cute small ones (like salad fork and dessert spoon size) at a resale/thrift store. || You‚Äôre already doing so much! Be proud of what you‚Äôve already changed! || I removed paper towels. We got about 20 of the super cheap ikea dish towels for like 79 cents each and use them instead of paper napkins and paper towels. We keep a roll of paper towels in the house and use them for a few things that are too gross or unsanitary for reusable (patting meat dry when we occasionally eat it) but go through <1 roll every few months. 

This is my favorite starting point because it has saved us sooo much money on paper towels and napkins and I feel like a lot of zero waste swaps require an upfront investment and pay off down the line. All the dish towels we bought upfront cost less than a pack of paper towels. || You‚Äôre making awesome progress!! One of the most impactful areas can be reducing/eliminating food waste, so perhaps that can be an area to assess over a week and see where there‚Äôs room for improvement. Whether it be just remembering to eat your leftovers from cooking/dining out, intentionally meal-planning when you‚Äôre able to, or utilizing some freezer space to help extend the life of fruits/veggies on their way out, there are plenty of big and little steps to take to fit any lifestyle. Thank you for your efforts! || bar soaps and buying in bulk. || Think of what you use the most of in your life routine and figure it what you can do to swap that for something that‚Äôs less wasteful?
For me it was finding bulk refill for laundry needs, handsoap which I rotate between soap bars and refilling the hand pump, and then shampoo/conditioning hair bars instead of disposable bottles.

"Reaction to shampoo bar, need direction","For the past month I've been using Kitsch Volumize shampoo and conditioner bar set. I've been loving it until my last hair wash 3 days ago (I typically wash my hair every 4 days and usually get mad at my scalp if I have to wash it every 3 days). Today I noticed my scalp becoming super itchy, which normally happens if I try going more than 4 days between washes.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I don't want to keep using Kitsch if it's making my scalp unhappy (since unhappy scalp eventually leads to unhappy hair). I feel like for tomorrow's wash (I'm going to try to win the battle with my scalp and not wash my hair tonight) I'm going to use bottled shampoo and conditioner (we have some that I bought for the family not too long before deciding to go back to shampoo bars), but what do I with Kitsch bars (I don't like using bars for shaving)?","If you have hard water, sometimes it is difficult to use a shampoo bar without buildup. You can use them on stuck zippers, etc. if you are looking for ways of upcycling them. || If your scalp is itching then I would tread carefully and go back to sulfates if you start experiencing any more symptoms like your hair feeling greasy after being washed. 

I used to have very curly hair that was wash and go, but decided to try the curly girl thing by going sulfate-free, doing no poo and using products. I trusted people when they said there was a transition/detox period where my hair would be greasier looking and my scalp would itch after stopping sulfates. I went for 6 months following what people said until my scalp developed crusts and I said no more and went back to using regular shampoo but it didn't fix my scalp. 

Now here I am almost 10 years later with horrible chronic seborrheic dermatitis. It gets so bad that it spreads to my eyelashes and causes blepharitis. My left eye was swollen shut for a week over this past Christmas holiday. I have to wash my hair daily, first with head and shoulders, then with a ketoconazole shampoo, absolutely no conditioner because the yeast feeds on fats. It's gotten to the point that I can no longer wear moisturizer on my face without developing severe fungal acne from it. I had to go buy a stack of white pillowcases because I have to change it out daily and then bleach my pillowcases after each use or they're greasy and smell bad. My face and scalp will start smelling like fucking cheese if I don't wash my scalp daily. It's disgusting and I've tried everything to treat it. || My offer it to friends, family, etc?

I alternate. Even when I was using bottled shampoo, my hair got used to the shampoo and they were becoming oily faster. I learned that by alterning different shampoo, it helps a lot to not get used to one and have a lot less problem with build up and so. So maybe buy another shampoo bar of a different type and alternate between the two. || If you only need to wash your hair every 4 days, the volumizing bar is too drying for your hair type.

PSA: Soda Stream machines are not recyclable,"Was super sad to find this out. Ours stopped working (gas would come out the side instead of going into the bottle). It was painstaking to take apart as they are not made to be repaired or serviced, and when I finally did I discovered that a tiny cheap plastic nipple attaches the CO2 nozzle to the CO2 cylinder and it has just sheared off, not repairable. 

Disappointing that a company with a supposed mission of being environmentally friendly uses very cheap plastic parts. Moreover, while they have a #7 recycling stamp on the machine parts, the plastic is all ABS and POM ‚Äî i.e. not actually recyclable. 

They offered me 40% off a replacement machine, and while their CS team is friendly and fast, they have made zero comment about the machine failing wildly, any safety implications of that, or any comment on their non-eco-friendly construction materials. I'm looking at the Enso (stainless steel) model, but I might just abandon their ecosystem entirely and go with a different brand.","Take a picture of the broken part.

The hard truth is that we all take from the planet, we all leave a carbon footprint. 

One real and absolute thing that we can do is to not consume.   And, that leads back to the anti consuming discussions.   

It matters not how many times you refill that bucket o' stuff at the refill store.  What really matters is that you think you need what ever it is , in the first place. 

It makes no difference that you look for organic cotton.  It matters that you bought 6 of them when you only needed one or two. 

It matters not that your shoes are made with recycled materaisl.  It matters that you have a closet full of shoes that you dont need or wear.  

I think that many of the posts here seem to lead to buyng and consuming with a cliche.   The term ""zero waste"" has become another form of green washing and feel good cutesy manner of consuming. 

Over consumption is at the heart of it.   Curbing our consuming habits and changing our expectations and habits is a real thing that we can do.   But will it save us from our own destruction?  No, it will not.   That is going to take a crisis of world wide proportions to do that.   We humans are not proactive.  We do, however, react and often   in violent ways. 

But, meantime it is another marketing tool to get us to consume more and to make us feel as if we are doing something good, but that is not true.

I use Gefen bar soap for handwashed dishes. It comes in a paper wrapper and is a bar. If you have a kosher store near you, it's there. If not, might be a bit harder to find. A lot of dish soap bars are aimed at people who want to feel good about being all natural; this ain't that. It is a commercial dish soap bar which has been on the market since before climate change was even a suspicion in the first scientist's mind because it was for people who keep a kosher/halal home, and it works.

Dental floss,"Hello! I‚Äôm looking for a zero waste dental floss, I bought Naturbrush bamboo one but it‚Äôs too thick, my teeth gaps are too narrow.

As you and others have said, silk floss is a fine option. While nylon will always hold up best, silk works just fine with cleaning and good brands can hold up well in tight contact points. Not all brands hold up well, but some of the other comments have good options.

I‚Äôve been happy with Tree Bird. I have tight gaps in some teeth as well and this holds up.

FWIW, I tried a silk floss branded by the Zero Waste Store (ZWS) - never again. I didn‚Äôt read the reviews beforehand unfortunately because many others had the same issue of it breaking every time. I had to throw it out. I asked them to refund based on the reviews and known issues of a ‚Äúbad batch of product,‚Äù and they would only give store credit. || Biom's silk expanding dental floss.

Pela case alternative,"This is my second Pela case for the same phone in 2 years. I appreciate the idea, but they're not proving very durable, despite doing a good job protecting from falls. And they are quite expensive.

I do this for pretty much everything actually lol || I always get otterbox.

I also stopped buying them and switched to used cases. || Ive had my pela case for more than a year and it has held up very well. 

Plus the whole reason I get pela is because it doesnt last.

I second what everyone is saying about used but I‚Äôd check FB market place before eBay to avoid shipping! || Second hand is absolutely one of the best options as noted by other commenters if you go with a plastic case.

On the other hand, I wanted to offer another perspective. We have been conditioned to expect things like phone cases to last years and years and years, because they have been made largely of plastic, which doesn't biodegrade. Part of the mindset shift that comes with moving toward a sustainable/low or zero waste lifestyle is recognizing that ""lasting forever"" isn't necessarily going to be available with non-plastic options, and maybe it shouldn't be. It's the same type of thing with plastic vs paper straws. Sure, if you leave your paper straw in your drink for six hours, it is going to get soggy and unusable, but the plastic straw that doesn't put a time limit on its usability means it is going to be just as durable and just as stubborn when it inevitably gets thrown away (which it will be in the end, whether you throw it away yourself or have someone else do it). 

IMO having to average one compostable case per year is a reasonable trade off for moving away from plastic. || Pela has a 1-year warranty on their cases so I think they know about this disintegration issue. I like the company and I like all the sustainability efforts in their supply chain. But yes, it appears their cases do not last. || I have only used Pela cases. My last phone had a Pela case for 3+ years. I replaced it after the last one had a small tear that bothered me. It could have lasted longer though. The second case was in perfect condition by the time I replaced my phone 2 years later. 

My new phone has had a Pela case for 6 months. Going strong with no damage at all. I have never experienced that kind of damage to my pela case but I'm always very nice to my phone. 

Maybe you just need to get a chunky protective case if you are tough on your devices. || I have a cheap one (~$10) that I've had on my phone for years. I've always felt that the more rubbery kind is more durable. || On the bright side, it‚Äôs doing what it said it does! Decompose üòÜ || I have a Woodcessories Bio Case for my iPhone 15.

Only other down-side is that there aren‚Äôt a ton of graphics or color options, but I just got black. || Get a high quality case like an otterbox, and get it used. That‚Äôs better than buying something new over and over even if it‚Äôs biod. || What‚Äôs more wasteful than a phone case?

A good case will often last longer than the phone it is in and you can sometimes get them online second hand (depends on the age and popularity of your phone) which is a far far better option. In the situation your phone has no second hand cases avalable the by buying a good quality case *then yourself making it avalable online for the next person* is going to be better. 

There is ultimately a drop off point where a phone is so antiquated or obscure that nobody wishes to buy a case for it. At that point trying to find a way to repurpose or responsibly disposing of the case is likely to be the best option. 

Ultimately if you break your phone because your eco case is trash then you are burning a lot more resources and effort even if you do all you can to repair the phone.

At this point I consider them to be a green washing company.

Castile soap for dishes,"I diluted Castile soap with water and put it in a spray bottle.

Is it really better* to order shampoo bars or to get shampoo at the store?,"(In California, USA if it makes a difference.) I'm wondering if it's more *environmentally friendly in the greater scheme of things to have special plastic-free shampoo delivered to my door, or if there's less waste/CO2/etc produced by buying a normal shampoo at a local store where they already have lots of products delivered in bulk? I know my special bar shampoo isn't being shipped all by itself through the USPS, but just wondering how these things work out in the end if anyone knows generally, or other relevant info. Thanks!!

Edit: thanks for the well-thought out answers! I appreciate your reasoning. Though if anyone knows of any stats or studies that show differences between eco-friendly, shipped products and conventional, local products, that would be awesome to see too.","A plastic bottle every month or two, which is still shipped, and it‚Äôs maybe even packaged overseas, easily a pound per bottle. Or a six month supply of bar shampoo that‚Äôs less than half the weight of a single month regular shampoo, and it‚Äôs shipped in a paper package. As long as you don‚Äôt order a single bar at a time and you‚Äôre far better off getting it shipped. || Why can‚Äôt you get a shampoo bar at the store? || The normal shampoo also means shipping around water. Rather substantial amounts of water. || This is a 'last mile' question, and context matters.  
  
For example, if you're going to the supermarket/store anyway, or it's on your way somewhere, it's probably better to pick it up yourself. Alternately, if you live in an apartment building where one delivery vehicle makes deliveries to multiple people in the building, that is probably more efficient.   
  
TL;DR You can either tell us your circumstances or make some judgments yourself about what is more efficient. || I buy them and other hygienic items in bulk for the year and for the entire household. I think that my method is reducing waste. || I'm guessing that it's really better to use the hair care products that work best on your hair but don't use more than you need. I have long thick hair but a little goes a long way. I use a quarter sized dollop and my bottles last 6 months. None of the bar products work for my hair so they all ended up in the trash. || Ethique (I believe) has shampoo bars at Ulta. I use their shampoo and conditioner bar. The box gets composted in my backyard. || I feel like there is carbon neutral shipping and co2 recapturing programs where a plastic bottle is truly just around forever. Can look in to the shipping your company uses because theoretically the plastic shampoo was also shipped to the store somehow. || Check out Etsy. There‚Äôs a way to find local sellers if you don‚Äôt mind hand made. 
Or if you like liquid shampoo, look for a refillery in your area to buy it bulk || Both the plastic shampoo bottle and the shampoo bar are being shipped \*somehow\*.  Even to the store.

The postman is coming to make a delivery anyway...

The shampoo bar is a lot lighter weight than a bottle of equivalent liquid shampoo, so the carbon cost of shipping will be smaller.

And you've just reduced the amount of plastic waste.

Seems to me the shampoo bar is a clear winner here. ||  I would avoid anything in a plastic bottle- will be around the planet literally forever. Better to order your shampoo bars and other eco-friendly products and have them shipped together, buying several months worth at a time. || FYI, ulta (and target if you‚Äôre shopping there) have a few brands with shampoo bars. The Kitsch brand is pretty popular so you‚Äôll likely find it in store and they work great for me! || For me I buy enough for the year, so I don't have to much packaging from shipping and less CO2 waste.   Shampoo and Conditional bars last about 6 months so I buy 2 sets at a time.  Same with my toilet tablets I get about a years supply at one time.  And then I'm done getting these things for the year. || They sell shampoo bars at trader Joe's and sprouts...


Edit: and I've seen them sometimes at tj Maxx, Marshalls ... || For me, it‚Äôs the environmental impact of shipping.  Saying ‚Äúwell they were shipping lots of things anyway‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem like an ethical answer to that. || i live in socially backwards alaska and we have shampoo bars at our local grocery store. id be surprised anywhere in the lower 48 you cant find them locally. || In a lot of this thread, drive time is referenced. Do you have an EV? Is a big box truck bringing it to you? We can zoom in or out a lot when it comes to consumption. We REALLY NEED to hold bigger companies feet to the fire on this if any real change will make a difference. My own composting/reusing/recycling is a small, conscious effort to smaller my footprint. It‚Äôs not enough. || The website i use for my shampoo bars uses established delivery routes. The trucks are going that direction anyways, they're just adding this company's orders to it, so little to no added emmissions. And because the products last so long, i tend to make one big order of everything i need, lasting me all year, instead of making a trip to the grocery store every few months.

I don't pay too much attention to sustainable manufacturing - for profit companies like to maximize profit, which often means minimizing waste and loss anyways. However, I'm aware that the smaller, ecofriendly company is less likely to destroy product over profit and more likely to upcycle unusable items. || You can get shampoo bars at stores as well.

More sustainable college apartment,"This is my very first post on Reddit ever so I hope I‚Äôm doing it right! 
I‚Äôm moving into an apartment in my college town and want to become more eco friendly. I have been making small, slow changes as I go (dryer balls, less paper towels, bar soap) but I want to tackle cleaning products if I can. I have a cat and struggle with germs and contaminants due to OCD. I clean A LOT! I hate using toxic chemicals and plastic bottles both because of the environment and my cat. I will often use vinegar and baking soda when I can for cleaning but sometimes it doesn‚Äôt feel like enough. 
I really want to use better cleaning products but I have no idea where to start and I‚Äôm on a college student budget. I have seen BlueLand but have heard negative results. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. ü´∂üèª
","Just use vinegar or baking soda by itself.  All you are making when you combine them is sodium acetate, which has little value as a cleaning agent.  What people really are doing is releasing carbon dioxide gas, which make the suspension foam up when soap is present.  People think the foam is useful, but it's really just a visual which they associate with cleaning potency.

Another excellent cleaning product is oxalic acid powder.  As the simplest dicarboxylic acid, it's very effective for removing rust stains, and cleaning metal, though it should not be kept in prolonged contact with surfaces.  It's very effective on toilets and tubs.  When used on baked on grease such as in an oven, it should be used as a paste made with hot water. || I‚Äôm a fan of ‚ÄúThe Queen of Clean‚Äù. A little old school, but she was an advice columnist for many years and has published several books of her cleaning wisdom. Her methods generally use only a simple list of five products, including borax, vinegar, and baking soda. I have always found I have better results with these ‚Äúdiy‚Äù cleaners than the expensive specialty ones at stores.

Something that might scratch your cleaning itch a little more is Grove Collaborative‚Äôs concentrated cleaners. Not the most zero waste, but they ship in tiny glass bottles that you then dilute with water in a spray bottle. You can get specialized cleaners from them like glass or tile. Good luck!

Zero waste products at drugstores?,"I am lucky enough to live in California and have access to local zero waste shops etc, but I have friends in other states looking to buy zero waste items and the closest store is cvs. 

I remember a few years ago cvs used to carry brands like cleancult, but now no longer do. I am struggling to find many of the zero waste or low waste items that I seem to remember even a few years back. Didn‚Äôt Colgate put out a mouthwash in aluminum cans? Where are all these initiatives now? These companies suck but still need to be held accountable. Of course they are claiming to do ~everything they can~ to reduce plastic waste by 2030 but we all know how likely that is. (See their 2020 goals). 

Do they sell anything remotely low /zero waste?","I too love to hate on household-name big corps that have been cashing in on unpriced externalities. Yet we do need them to provide solutions on this front, as their scale can move markets and demand in a significant way.  

For truly sustainable products (not just the green-label type), I'd recommend specialized online retailers (certainly not Amazon). It implies having to reuse the packaging to avoid it becoming waste, but most compost usually needs a bit of extra carbon either way.  

Until the big dogs see there's money to be made in this, they are unlikely to prioritize product development beyond experimental or PR splash || Just do your best and send signals with what you do purchase.

zero waste groceries?,"I know there are many maneuvers to minimize waste in grocery shopping. But sometimes I feel that this leads to all sort of ‚Äúrun-around‚Äù going to multiple places, strategizing reuse, avoiding a large fraction of products, etc‚Ä¶ I can do this, but it doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúscaleable‚Äù. That is to say, a person making a decent effort can do it; but it seems at the systems level saying ‚Äúdo all these individual strategies to minimize waste‚Äù isn‚Äôt going to really lead to major reduction in waste overall. 

Does anyone know of any places (in person or online) where you can get the majority of a weekly grocery order with no or minimal plastic? I don‚Äôt. Seems like it would be a reasonable business idea, and needed for change to really happen at a larger scale. I suppose better even might be if existing chain grocers adopt zero waste practices‚Ä¶ but how likely is that? For example, Aldi seems to be trying (according to their website) but the reality of a shopping haul there is that a lot of plastic waste is unavoidable. I know of websites for zero waste household supplies which is nice, but groceries seem to be a bigger challenge.

Edit: Thanks all appreciate the insights! I‚Äôve actually made some progress on this. Plan is to do a big bulk run for pantry items at sprouts on rare occasion, get produce more frequently at local places I don‚Äôt need to drive to and sell without plastic. Staying away from stuff with unnecessary packaging when there are plenty of alternatives around. Some stuff (ex: milk, juice, cheese) don‚Äôt have an easy solution, but that‚Äôs way less than before. ","i think you are doing as much as you can, and are correct that it is a systemic issue. but corporations have spent billions convincing consumers the problem can be solved by individual consumer actions. it can't. [recycling is a perfect example.](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/24/1131131088/recycling-plastic-is-practically-impossible-and-the-problem-is-getting-worse) rather than restrict plastic packaging, we're told if we toss it in a blue bin all is right with the world. 

just find ways that you can incorporate better practices, but don't exhaust yourself so much that you don't have energy / time to get active pushing for systemic change. 

get active in an area you are really passionate about. 

if grocery waste is it, read up and research effective ways to reduce that waste. is it advocating for a ban on plastic bags in your city? is it finding a way to compost food waste from groceries? even if it's just one store, start the process. 

i'm a big advocate for getting folks to repair rather than replace household items. so i've been active with the Right to Repair movement and local Fix It Clinics. they are so empowering. not only are you keeping a household appliance out of the landfill, you are showing someone how to repair and maintain their own items!

of course there are corporate lobbyists out there literally trying to \*ban\* DIY repairs and even access to the diagnostic tools for things like vehicles and other commercial equipment.

back to the groceries... see if any stores near you have a bulk section. we've got a great dry goods section at our local store, everything from nuts and dried fruits to spices and teas. we use cloth bags and the occasional paper bag. granted, most everyone else i see in there are just using the plastic bags they offer for use...

also realize plastic has it's place in some cases. without air-tight plastic packaging, meats would have a much shorter shelf-life, and more would be wasted. i say that, but also try to frequent our local butcher where everything is cut fresh and it's wrapped in butchers paper. || Try looking up bulk sellers in your area. Some stores will sell flour, nuts, candy, etc out of bulk bins where you can bring your own container. 

Instead of buying single yogurt cups, we buy a big thing of plain yogurt and add jam to it. It‚Äôs not 100% zero waste but you can use the big yogurt containers as pots for plants or reuse them with the lid as regular non-food storage containers.

Same concept for anything you buy at the grocery store‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs better to buy things in glass or cardboard than plastic but if you need to get something in plastic, get a big container of it and portion it out at home. 

You don‚Äôt have to put produce in the plastic bags they have out either, you can literally just put the fruits and veggies in your cart as-is and the cashier will weigh and scan them the same. The only thing I don‚Äôt do this with is herbs or leaf lettuce, but I reuse the bags to scoop used cat litter into.

The onus is really more on companies in the end. Do the best you can, don‚Äôt pull your hair out if you have to buy something that‚Äôs not perfect. || All I can say is how much I appreciate this post in a sea of those about shampoo bars. 

There is so much to be done when it comes to grocery packaging! As another comment said, sometimes plastic is really the only better option due to spoilage concerns and the like. But there is so much unnecessary packaging as well. Bulk foods are an option in some cases, but to be frank, many of the items that one can buy in bulk aren't as badly packaged as so much else; many come in paperboard or paper containers. || My grocery runs are never zero waste, but it's easy to drastically reduce waste without having to run around all over the city.

I go to just one store for my pantry items. Whichever one has the lowest price for my complete grocery list. To reduce plastic waste, I choose options that are packed in cardboard/paper and/or in bulk quantities. 

For fresh produce I like to see it myself so I go to a local produce market where almost everything is unpackaged and they provide cardboard boxes to take it home.

Cosmetic Recycling,"Hey all üëãüèΩ I‚Äôve been on a zero waste/sustainability journey, and one of the many things I‚Äôve been conscious of is my beauty waste.

Trouble with Shampoo Bars,"Hi! I love all forms of bars for my soaps and conditioners but I have been struggling to find a good shampoo bar that does not leave a thick coating on my hair. 

I used to buy from a company called ‚ÄúSilver Falls Sustainability Co.‚Äù cause I had no problem with the bar. I literally didn‚Äôt need to shower my hair for a whole week and my hair would look great, but I‚Äôm pretty sure they changed their formula for the shampoo bars because when my hair fully dries, it leaves my hair feeling really gross like the soap is still there. 

I also tried to support two local small businesses in my area for their hair shampoo bars but both are just making my hair feel really oily. I don‚Äôt lather the bar directly on my hair, I usually grab some in my hands and then put it in my hair so I really don‚Äôt know the problem.

Any recommendations for shampoo bars for someone with straight hair? Am I doing something wrong?","Make sure you‚Äôre using a bar with detergent (sodium laurel sulfate & sodium coco sulfate are two common ones), not just a soap bar that‚Äôs marketed as shampoo (listed ingredient are pretty much just oils on those.)

Also you might need to use more product and/or double cleanse. My hair is quite thick and I use a lot of product AND I have hard water, so I part it in multiple sections and rub the bar along the parts, then scrub. I also double cleanse. Unless your hair is very short and fine/thin I can‚Äôt imagine that just getting some on your hands would be enough! Or maybe I‚Äôm just wasting my bar, lol. || do you have hard water? the minerals in hard water interact with oils in soaps and will create a waxy coating. you could try a diluted apple cider vinegar rinse to counteract that or invest in a water softener for your shower. i have the same issue || I really like Hi Bar || I really like kitsch bars! || Dip and Ethique are my favorites. Dip is more high-end in fragrance (and price), whereas Ethique is more bang for your buck, but both are similar in quality and result.

Edit to add: Ethique survived Indiana hard water! || Have you tried HiBar?? || Viori pricey, but oh so nice on the hair. At Sephora || Not a bar but I spend $20 on a 32oz plastic bottle of shampoo that lasts me a year and a half (Short curly hair, I wash once a week) so I would consider it very minimal waste for the money, can use the bottle for something else like plants. Just what I do || I like Liggett - I help out at a food shelf and they give us boxes of their ""trim"". || I struggled with similar stuff and have really been enjoying Vunella shampoo bars. 

Their marketing emails suck tho. 

Good luck! || I really like the soapnuts bar from Chagrin Valley. || The ones from Lush are great and they don‚Äôt leave a residue! However I stopped using them because I found out they have sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and I just prefer not to use anything with SLS on my hair. Now I use regular liquid, SLS-free shampoo that I refill at my local zero-waste shop. If SLS doesn‚Äôt bother you I highly recommend the ‚ÄúHoney I Washed My Hair‚Äù shampoo bar from Lush. It smells soooooo good || Agree with everyone suggesting hibar, I tried several different shampoo bars and theirs worked best for me. My hair‚Äôs fairly fine and a little wavy.

Dip smells fantastic, but is pretty expensive. || Of the shampoo bars I‚Äôve tried Humby Organics is the only one that didn‚Äôt leave a residue on my hair.  An additional plus is their non plastic packaging. || I have straight hair as well. Medium strands, thick amount, moderate porosity. 

HiBar definitely does not leave a waxy coating! I have experienced that with bruu bar, so I know what you're talking about. HiBar does have that *other* problem typical of shampoo bars, which is that it's quite stripping. I always condition with every wash anyway (it's just my hair type; I've had to do it even when I used to use liquid hair care. It may sound crazy to us Westerners but in Japan for example it's common to shampoo and condition your hair everyday, just like a shower!) but if you use HiBar you will have to find some way to introduce a little additional moisture to your hair.

Deodorant Dilemma,"Last year I finally made the bold decision to switch from my go to Secret brand  antiperspirant/deodorant to deodorant packaged in a cardboard tube. I love the scents that my new deodorant comes in, and it‚Äôs works for me for most of the year. I originally decided to make the switch because I read that one of the ingredients in antiperspirant could have negative effects on fertility. My husband and I were a few months from starting our IVF egg retrieval and I was desperate to improve our chances. My second motivation was to decrease the waste from the plastic tube.

Over a year after making the switch, and I‚Äôm now 29 weeks pregnant. I also anticipate not needing to do another egg retrieval as we completed 2 and hopefully have enough embryos for a second pregnancy. I was gifted three bags of maternity clothes from a friend and I‚Äôm finding my sweat is ruining my maternity shirts. My efforts to lower my plastic waste is ruining my clothes.

Has anyone found an antiperspirant that actually works that was zero or low waste? It‚Äôs summer where I live and I tend to sweat a lot. It‚Äôs manageable for most of the year, but obviously not right now. I think once the weather cools down I can switch back to my low waste deodorant. ","Honestly deodorant is one of the few things (along with medical supplies and toilet paper) that I feel is hard to replace with a zero waste option. Something about the all natural versions irritates my armpits and makes me stink no matter what. I only buy one once every couple months anyway.

That being said, I‚Äôve heard that alum powder or bars works really well but I don‚Äôt know how safe it is for pregnant people. || Oddly, it might be the deodorant staining your clothes, not the sweat. Look it up. || Antiperspirants reduce sweat. Deodorants are fragrances to cover up sweat odors. They are not the same beast. Most antiperspirants are sold as antiperspirant/deodorants. Most ‚Äúnatural‚Äù deodorants have no anti-sweat ingredients. || I would honestly stop using it immediately cause you don‚Äôt want to ruin all your clothes! Maybe try out Wild as a lower waste option? They sell at target, less waste than the plastic tubes & hasn‚Äôt ruined my clothes. If you‚Äôre worried about fertility health though I would personally wait before going back to your old secret brand! Just for your own peace of mind¬† || We use little seed farm (the gray one) that comes in a small glass jar. It's a cream and my husband swears by it. 
Now will it stop you from sweating in high heat outside? No  but will you smell bad and ruin your clothes with a deodorant that won't come out? No as well || I like using an alcohol-based deodorant. But that‚Äôs because baking soda and magnesium-based ones give me a rash. I also prefer light scents. Does it work during summer for very long, no. But I no longer care. 

Also, nothing, and I mean absolutely nothing will cover postpartum smell. And that lasts 3-6 months or maybe longer. It‚Äôs hypothesized that it‚Äôs for baby to identify its mother for breastfeeding. I still use the alcohol based deodorant because I don‚Äôt want expose my babies (I have a toddler and a 6 month old) to something not good for them or cover too much of my smell for them. 

Also, your sense of smell is heightened while pregnant and early postpartum (mine has never gone back down to baseline) || I used Little Seed Farm deodorant. It comes in a small glass jar, so it's plastic free. And it works so so well. I think I sweat more than other people, and this keeps me dry all day. You can also get a little wooden applicator olfor it, but I just use my fingertip and wash my hands after applying. A little goes a long way. || I have not used it myself but I came across a brand called Helmm that makes antiperspirants (not just deodorant) that comes in a refillable container. Pricey though, and they seem to be marketed towards men so their fragrances may lean masculine.¬† || Genuinely curious - how is your sweat ruining the clothes? I sweat in my clothes all the time, but I‚Äôve never had sweat ruin clothing. 

I use Etee‚Äôs deodorant paste and it works really well. It‚Äôs not an antiperspirant, but I‚Äôve never heard of a zero waste antiperspirant because sweat is a natural process. I think of it like how you won‚Äôt find many eco friendly nail polishes or self-tanners. There‚Äôs nothing inherently wrong with those things, but they aren‚Äôt a very natural product, so eco-conscious companies aren‚Äôt motivated to make them. 

If you really feel like you need the antiperspirant, then use it in the summer months and switch back to your other deodorant that you say works for the cooler months. It‚Äôs okay to use a product or two that isn‚Äôt zero waste. It‚Äôs just all about being more mindful of your choices and making swaps where you can. Congratulations on your pregnancy! || I had this problem with Native, it was the only one that ‚Äúworked‚Äù without giving me rashes (after trying *several* brands) & I loved the cardboard tubes - the deo was horrible on my clothes though.  I‚Äôm also a sweaty AF person and eventually just gave up and made my peace with this being one thing I‚Äôm gonna keep buying in plastic.  I use a clear gel and put on clothes after it‚Äôs dried, no more issues. || I tend to wear a lot of black. If I'm wearing a coloured top or blazer, I'm probably wearing a sweat-proof undershirt (e.g., Thompson Tee or Numi). || I am really liking [evolve together](https://evolvetogether.com/evolvetogether) deordorant.

I'm allergic to formulations with baking powder, and they use arrowroot powder (I think).

The one carton ive bought has also lasted me over a year || I recommend NOT using antiperspirants. Find a good deodorant with all natural ingredients if you can. || Ethique is a good brand || I don't have a deodorant suggestion but when I get that on my shirts a scrub with some dish soap seems to clear it up since it is oil based usually. Alternatively, you could get some of those sweat pads you put in your shirt (or I have undershirts that have that) which helps a TON. || I use magnesium oil spray. I swear by this!!

Laundry products that actually make clothes smell good after the wash and dry?,"I am currently using the Attitude laundry detergent. It has a nice, pleasant scent but once the laundry comes out of the washer and dryer I can barely smell the scent. Sometimes the clothes can even smell terrible. Does anyone have recommendations for detergents, scent boosters, dryer sheets, or any laundry products that actually leave clothes smelling fresh and nice for a while?

Open to any tips or product suggestions! Thanks!

\--- edit ---

Some more contexts. I don't have an in-unit washer or dryer, so I have to use the ones that are shared with other people and after drying, my clothes smell like, well, college dorm laundry, if you are familiar with that smell. So maybe the bad smell comes from the terribly scented detergents/dryer sheets others are using. I don't know if there's anything I can do about that, so I was thinking about using some pleasently scented products to cover that up...","If your clothes smell terrible after coming out of a wash or dry I promise it‚Äôs not the detergent, it‚Äôs your washing machine. Look into how to clean your model. I once had to take out the full basket and the entire outside was covered in a layer of slime/mold. || A few things, your washing machine probably needs to be cleaned. 

Clean it then make sure you keep the washing machine door open between washes so it dries out. It‚Äôs a breeding ground for bad smelling bacteria if you allow it to fester. 

Second, lower the heat if your dryer. You never need to dry anything higher than the low setting. High heat might just be burning your clothes. || If your laundry stinks after it‚Äôs dry, there‚Äôs something on it.  

Attitude is better than average as plant based detergents go even if the formula does look more like face wash than detergent.  What it lacks are enzymes.  

Start with sticking your head in your washer.  If it doesn‚Äôt smell clean and neutral, your laundry won‚Äôt.  I like 1/2 c of citric acid crystals in a cleaning cycle with the hottest possible water.  If your machine doesn‚Äôt have a sanitize/extra hot setting, run the hot water tap nearest the machine before you start the cycle.  Citric acid removes mineral and laundry product buildup very effectively.   

The next thing I would try to get very lightly fragranced but exceedingly clean laundry is to wash on Warm with Attitude and add 1/4 cup of Biz powder to the wash basket before you add the clothing.  This will add oxygen bleach to rip up odors and help keep the machine clean and a slate of enzymes that take off what wearing clothes puts on.    $7, comes in a cardboard box, works ridiculously well.  

When you finish the jug of Attitude, you might try the 365 by Whole Foods products.  Both the powder and the liquids are excellent and have complete enzyme packages, at a decent price. 

Throw two teaspoons of the citric acid crystals in the softener dispenser to improve rinse performance.  That will reduce the likelihood of anything that can turn smelly lingering in the clothing. || Be aware that most laundry products are full of nasty artificial fragrances that can be toxic and are endocrine disrupters.  I prefer to go for eco brands that are kinder to the environment and skin - I get fragrance free then add a few drops of my favourite essential oils into the dispenser. || Do your local community a favor and opt for more neutral-scented laundry products. Those strong scents make me so sick, and I know I'm not the only one. I am assaulted daily with super strong laundry odors from other people out in the world. || If your clothes smell terrible after coming out of the washer or dryer, I'd try adding a booster like Borax or Oxiclean  and running them on hot to actually get the smell out rather than adding fragrance to cover it up || try cleaning the machine by running an empty hot load with lemme shine, citric acid, or vinegar. || Meliora works great! Best thing ive ever used. || The dryer heat cooks off most smells so wait to add smells after the dryer.
I use an essential oil room spray and mist the warm clothes. Plus you can add a spritz in the closet or drawers that your clothes are stored in¬† || use vinegar in your rinsing cycle it will hep preserve your washer and take out smells. 

some add a few drop of essential oils for a good smell .

better dry your clothes on a line: more eco friendly and better smelling! || OG tide is always my favorite (powder form). It just smells clean. But I agree with another commenter in that I think this is an issue with your washing machine, or not taking your laundry out fast enough. || Drying on a washing line smells much better than a dryer. Fresh, plus the scents used stay in the clothes more || I just dont understand this with people talking about thier laundry needing to have perfumed odors added to  it because it smells bad or just to make it smell ""fresh"".   The only time I have ever had it take on odor is if it somehow got forgotten and left in the tub.    The solution to that problem was just to rewash it, and not to add perfume to it.   

I think that so many people associate a perfume with ""fresh"" and that is clever marketing on the part of the household chemical industry.   

Meantime we modern folks living a modern life have the greatest advatntages of staying clean than ever in  human history.    Most of us have clean running water, appliances that do the work for us and that wonderful indoor plumbing, and local facitlities for treating the sewage.   Yet, we somehow think that is not enough!

I watched a program about the historic lifestyles of old Europe and I would not wish those horrors on anyone!  Talk about nasty!   Life in some place like London in the year 1500 was a nightmare of nastiness, lack of bathing and buckets of raw sewage.  And, there was the idea that washing of the skin was detrimental.  All manner of disease and disgust was abundant.

Some of my own ancestors were shipped to the  new colonies from London after being  found to be thieves.

They were put on a ship and dropped in the wilderness of what is now Virginia.  Punishement?  I think not.  It was clean and there was opportunity .   I would call that a win. || Clean clothes don‚Äôt have an artificial smell.

Pela phone case fell apart shortly after a year,"I am sharing this to give a review of the Pela case and to ask if there is an alternative view to the one I have about a case that falls apart so quickly. I welcome any disagreements or suggestions. Thank you!

So my case fell apart at the charging port and at the volume buttons. It became unusable as it started to tear at the top as well. It finally became unusable at around 13 months but the damage around the charging port happened much earlier and I was living with it.

My wife's case fell apart in the same ways at the same time.

I've never had this happen with a phone case before and I was disappointed.

I believe there's no point in a recycled case if I have to buy multiple ones during my phone's life.

I wish there was a sturdier case that was made from recycled or recyclable materials.","In my opinion these types of cover are very low quality. I buy a phone (this one, an iohone 11 was gifted by previous job) and a good strong case like otterbox. Is very not zero waste, but is indestructible and last as long as the phone, the fact that is super bulky help with the life of the phone as well, so less waste this way.¬† || So weird, I've had a lot of pela cases and have one now and have no issues. I drop my phone all the time and wipe it down at least once a day with antibac wipes and it has held up just fine. Maybe you and your wife got a bad batch? I would email them and see if you can maybe get a discount code or something for some new ones! || I'm sorry to hear you two have had negative experiences :( I think I had similarly high hopes for Pela cases when I bought mine ~3 years ago, and have since been largely satisfied. 

Mine tore around the charging port and volume buttons on year 2, and has since trucked along unchanged for another year. 

One point of clarification: my understanding is that Pela cases are compostable, not recyclable. I'm curious if yours are a different product line than mine? Compostability is an important quality to me because it means the product will breakdown into non-toxic substances that contribute to soil health. Recyclable means you can make derivative plastic products from it. 

My perspective is that any phone is case is (hopefully) going to do what it was designed to do: 
- A good plastic case will protect your phone for the phone's lifetime, but is ultimately a dense plastic. After it's usable life, it may, rarely, be recycled into a lower quality plastic. Or, more likely, go on to last 500+ years in a landfill as it breaks down into smaller chunks of plastic. 
- The Pela case might only last a couple years (though it seems yours was much shorter unfortunately), but then only take 24 months to compost into natural elements. 

This is a trade off I'm happy to make; I look at my case and see it starting that breakdown process, and in a way think ""nice :)""


Edit: grammar and organization. || I‚Äôve been using Pela cases for the last 6+ years - first one got chewed a bit by a dog but I held onto it until I upgraded my phone (and it no longer fit), then I bought 2 on a deal, and the one I‚Äôve been using has only very recently split at the charging port after 3 years of regular use so I‚Äôve been very happy with quality. Still have another one to use too if/when this one breaks down further || I'm surprised to hear yours fell apart bc I love mine! I drop my phone all the time (liker seriously, several times a day onto tile floor) and have NEVER had an issue. Phone is scratch free. My husband has an Otterbox and the same type of phone, broke the screen in the first couple of months. To my mind, the phone itself is the biggest environmental issue, so I'm happy to replace the degradable case every 3 or 4 years if it means I don't have to replace my phone as often! I have an older Samsung so maybe it's a design thing, but no issues with tears until year 3 or more for me. At that point I'm OK with a new case.
Would love to see more options available to folks though if Pela isn't your thing or doesn't work for your phone model! || I bought a Pela case in late 2022 for my Pixel 7 Pro specifically because it's compostable. I liked it, but as others have mentioned, it only lasts about a year before it starts falling apart.

I bought a 3D printer in early 2024 and one of the many things I've printed is my own compostable phone cases with flexible PHA. So far they've only lasted a few months before starting to fall apart around the port and button holes, though I had no problem using them for a few more months with part of the top edge missing. It's less than $2 in material and electricity and I don't feel guilty about having something to toss in the compost and trying to make the next one better. That's about 3% the cost of a Pela case and roughly 15% the annual cost, and it only takes about 3 hours to print, so I think that's worth having to replace it more often. I emboss text on the inside to remind me or anyone else that it's made of PHA and safe to compost. I have several different colors of PHA and a few patterned print beds to give the back of the case a cool dynamic effect, so each new case can be different in some way.

This hobby taught me how to design my own models, mostly functional stuff for other hobbies and around the house. I buy and waste less because I can often build it myself to my specifications and the exact quantity I need, often with less effort than shopping around since I'm not so concerned about cost, how long it takes to receive it, what country it's made in, or the trouble I would have to go through if it fails to meet my needs. Case in point, I needed a single valve stem cap for my car because I lost one, so I printed one for 4 cents; good luck buying a single cap from anywhere. I could go on and on... || Never skimp or cheap out on phone cases‚Ä¶ I learned my lesson the hard way way and my husband and I¬†do IT for a living!¬†

In the past, I spent way too much money on iPhone repairs because of poor phone cases‚Ä¶ and because I was too stubborn to listen to my husband and not be so frugal with certain things. I‚Äôve thrown out many broken phone cases.¬†

I had countless screen and camera part replacements over the years. I have not had a phone repaired since I broke down and bought an Otterbox two iPhones ago. I swear by OB now.¬†

I have ADHD and dyspraxia and really bad proprioception and that doesn‚Äôt bode well for my iPhones because they don‚Äôt bounce. Until I got an OtterBox. It doesn‚Äôt pay to not adequately protect your very expensive phone/pocket pc!¬† || I have one on my phone and suffered the same fate. Seems like I‚Äôve had it for a year or maybe a little longer. I thought their whole deal was that it‚Äôll degrade instead of sit in a landfill for decades. I never expected it to last more than it has tbh. || I got the compostable one from Incipio and it fell apart within an hour of it being on my phone. Don't get that one! I don't want to buy plastic but breaking my phone would certainly be more wasteful, so I'm reluctantly looking at regular cases. I can't justify the cost of the Pela case either. || Mine too || I've had mine for 4 months and so far so good, albeit this is a short amount of time to judge a phone case. That being said, the phone grip thing fell apart after a month which was extremely disappointing.¬† || Yours lasted a year? I think mine did that at about 3 months. It was an absolute joke. I subscribe to the notion that a case, while wasteful, keeps my very expensive and environmentally costly phone from breaking, and needs to serve its purpose as best as it can. Ultimately the cases are small peanuts from an environmental standpoint, and I go for the best ones for my needs. || When my (non green) case fell apart, my alternative was to find a thrifted one. I actually tried to buy a new one first because time was of the essence, I can‚Äôt be trusted with an uncovered phone, but couldn‚Äôt find one made of silicon to fit my tiny little SE in any stores or on Amazon for under $40. Then one day I walked into a local thrift store and found 2 of them in the dollar bin. Ultimately it was just luck but would‚Äôve been a lot easier if I had a bigger phone. || Pela cases are a gimmick and also not really biodegradable or special in any way. There are videos about this on YouTube. || My Pela cases usually make it past the two year mark, and I only buy when they‚Äôre having their buy-1-get-1-free sales. The grips, though, are not resilient ‚Äî all of mine tore after less than a year.¬†

Check eBay for lightly used (and much cheaper) Pela cases, there‚Äôs tons available. || I have a wave phonecase (ironically, I was going to go with Pela but they have like zero fucking options for android phones that aren't the newest model in their line) and it's lasting pretty well. The case is still biodegradable and compostable, so it might be liable to the same types of failures after a couple years, but wave cases are about half the price of Pela cases; mine was only 35 USD. || I currently have a Pela case that also split at the charging port (nowhere else though) maybe 2 years after I bought it. It‚Äôs still usable so I live with it. For now.

I don‚Äôt know which approach is better, buying a regular strong and sturdy case or just getting one made with recycled materials but I am holding onto the one I have for as long as possible || Oh for sure I was so pumped about the pela case years ago, it fell apart in like two months. Bummer to hear nothing has changed || I've had mine for 2 months and just noticed the other day that it's starting to split near the charging port. I've had a look at the case and how I plug my charger in and have realised that the top of the charging port hole is really close to the charging port so it gets caught when you plug your charger in.

Apart from that the only other thing I've noticed is that the pattern is wearing off on one of the corners. I've been wanting to try a Pela case for years but wasn't in a country they shipped to. I used a buy one get one free offer and got free postage thankfully. It definitely doesn't seem as sturdy as a friend's I saw years ago but I don't have any major complaints. || I don‚Äôt like pela cases. I‚Äôve seen them advertised as ‚Äúbackyard biodegradable‚Äù and they very much are NOT that.

No access to recycling,"Does anybody else live in an area that has no access to recycle? Of course I recycle bottles/containers and such around the house but I‚Äôm having a hard time getting rid of the excess cartons, paper, and cardboard around my house in a way that‚Äôs not just throwing it away because recycling is not an accessible option. The only options I can find is private recycling and it‚Äôs charging around $30+ a drop off which is outrageous. ","Use cardboard and cartons without glossy ink as browns in compost! Visit r/composting to learn more || that was my situation for a few years in one of my apartment so I brought everything to work lol || I have limited recycling and in some places I‚Äôve had to take my recycling 30 minutes away (it stacked up). The best way is to limit your use of items that you can‚Äôt recycle. Recycling isn‚Äôt a perfect answer, it‚Äôs to reduce your usage as best you can. || So, unfortunately, the U.S. has very little capacity to actually recycle and many items are just dumped in the landfill anyway. Years ago, we used to ship our recycling to China but they stopped taking our trash a while back. If your local area is not offering recycling, it may be because they are more honest than the ones who just dump residents' recycling in the landfill.

Keep looking into ways to reuse old items and petition for change. We could be doing so much more but have opted for convenience instead. || The only good solution is get your government to implement a proper publicly-funded recycling system. Otherwise, private organizations are only going to collect what is profitable. In order to collect the marginal categories like styrofoam, soft plastic, paper or whatever else, you're going to need support from a publicly funded organization. Start talking to your neighbors, and start putting pressure on your local government that you want a proper recycling system. || assuming youre in the US.. 

Imo, our version of recycling is so warped. So many people do it incorrectly, which taints the entire ""batch"" of recycling. No employees care to sort through it/ they arent mandated to do so (maybe seen as a waste of time?). 

People recycle incorrectly because its not a universal solution. Example, county A requires you to keep the water bottle lid ON, county B requires lids to be off, county C requires lids off and separated to another type of recycling, county D requires lids on but no labels... its so overcomplicated. And unfortunately I dont see our government working to standardize the process anytime soon. 

best case to remember the 3 R's and their order: REDUCE your consumption is best, REUSE being second best, RECYCLE being last option. 

***remember, us common folk using a case of water a month isnt the issue; its the overconsumption and lack of care by corporations contributing to mass waste. 

You cant do all the good the world needs, but the world needs all the good you can do. || I was going to post this same question. 
Yea, I live somewhere where there aren‚Äôt designated bins for sorting and recycling waste. Like you I‚Äôve tried to reuse and recycle plastic and cardboard, but it‚Äôs still too much for one person. I also don‚Äôt live somewhere where there are stores that I can go to to refill my own container of food/produce. So I end up having a lot of peanut butter and honey jars, a lot of cereal boxes, cartons, plastic milk jugs, plastic produce bags and all the packaging that needs to be recycled. I too can‚Äôt afford the private waste collection  and recycling companies that exist, so I really feel you. It‚Äôs so frustrating. || The sad backstory to this is that, so far, paper recycling is not really profitable; hence the charge. It would become profitable if there were tax incentives (or disincentives for new manufacture). 

On the plus side, of all the forms of excess waste, paper products are the least harmful. Ultimately they are biodegradable (excluding coatings and some inks), so if you have to focus on maximizing your plastic and metal recycling you're doing OK. And if you think there's a chance your local municipality might respond to public pressure to start paper recycling, give a little energy to that. || There used to be a paper and cardboard dumpster outside a Kroger near me. Also big box stores sometimes have cardboard dumpsters. I used to get moving boxes from a big sports store. If I couldn‚Äôt find anything else, I‚Äôd try chucking appropriate items in there when no one was around. Not sure that‚Äôs comfortable for everyone though. Unfortunately this is a systemic problem caused by capitalism but we take responsibility individually bc that‚Äôs all we can do. || i brought my recyling to friends houses when i visited. || I would gladly drive 30 min to drop off recycling and would be okay with a small fee even. The county next to me stopped, then my county stopped, then more surrounding counties. The entire area I live in of my state has no plastic or glass recycling centers anymore. Most counties don‚Äôt even offer recycling services now and the ones that do just send the recycling across the state. I have to drive to Nashville (1 hour away) if I want to recycle glass as that‚Äôs the only place I‚Äôm aware of. || Same. I worry that the pollution I would cause by driving to and from the drop-off is more harmful than just tossing everything. || Shred and compost if you can! Do you have a scrap yard at all near you? You can usually use a scrap yard for metal recycling with the bonus of potentially getting a few bucks. Some will take whole e-waste or other categories as well.

It's not really an eco-friendly solution, but in past situations I ended up just burning the paper goods and using the ash in the yard. || Target, walmart and best buy take various recyclables.

Frigidaire water filters,"Is there any way to recycle an old Frigidaire water filter? This question has been asked before a few years back, but I don‚Äôt see any solution. I‚Äôm sad thinking about all the discarded plastic that replacing filters will create over the years. And I don‚Äôt see any return program for Frigidaire. Thanks in advance for any ideas! ","Do you have a ""regular"" recycling for plastics? Like a bin that gets picked up and you can put in thicker plastics in as well? Or a place you go regularly and drop things of?

If you can operate a handsaw or serrated knife safely you could cut the thing open and recycle it yourself. I expect there to be resin beads and maybe some mesh with carbon inside. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs recyclable, so it‚Äôs probably residual wase. And try not to get it everywhere. Maybe cut in a big container.

All the plastic bits go into recycling. See if there is a little mark on it to know what material it‚Äôs made of. That way you can check if your recycling place can recycle that.

Think about **reduce** before recycling: If you drinking water is safe could simply not use a filter. I have made a measured comment on it [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1kbf7xy/comment/mpu292j/?context=3&utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). See below. Maybe there is a dummy filter available for your fridges water thing doesn‚Äôt work without one. Just make sure clean it regularly.

>I assume two main reasons for using a water filter: taste and the water not being (perceived) as safe. I sincerely hope your tap water is safe to drink and it‚Äôs a taste or habit thing. So:

>Give it a try without the filter.

>At first try directly from the tap. See if you family can get use to this. Or from a pitcher in which the water stood a bit (in the fridge). ¬†Especially if you water is chlorinated, over time some evaporates and thus it tastes less like it. No purchase/waste necessary.

>Maybe you can even use your fridge system without the filter installed. Just remember to clean it sometimes.

Which cut-down waste and/or zero-waste habit is hardest for you to stick with?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôve been trying to cut-down on waste for a while now, but in my neighborhood in the Netherlands it‚Äôs not easy to maintain. Everything we buy is still packed in plastic and/or paper and/or cardboard. So, we try to sort our plastic, paper, and general waste, and preferably also our biowaste. As I do know, in the end all the waste are thrown together and are again separated at the waste management site. So, why the effort? But it feels right.

We live in an apartment and are assigned to plastic, paper, and general waste bins in front of the building. We have only a small balcony so having our own compost bin is not an option. We did asked for biowaste bins, and the municipality approved it, but we don‚Äôt know when they will be placed. We don‚Äôt even have glass bins nearby. We do collect our glass and bring it with us when we go grocery shopping.

At home it is easy enough to separate our waste, but it is not very motivating when your surroundings doesn't make it easy. I feel like it should be much easier, right?

What is your experience in your neighborhood? Which cut-down waste or zero waste habit has been the hardest for you to stick with, like bulk shopping, avoiding plastic, composting, or something else? If you have found a way to make it easier I would love to hear about it too.","Toiletries. I have tried almost every deodorant/antiperspirant in natural packaging and none of them work for me. I also have severe tooth sensitivity and fight gingivitis, so I use toothpaste high in fluoride and an electric toothbrush. My shaved head needs at least SPF 30 reapplied frequently or I burn. 

I try my best, but those are the items I find that I have to deal with buying it in plastic. || [deleted] || For me it‚Äôs protein. Due to health reasons, plant based eating isn‚Äôt enough unless I‚Äôm paying for vitamin injections monthly (very expensive). You can‚Äôt avoid the plastic when you buy chicken or fish where I live. Also good sunscreens are never in metal or glass containers, having a parent that passed from melanoma I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice my health for a low waste option. I‚Äôm hoping one day more sunscreen brands will switch to metal tubes or tins! || God the food waste. I have ADHD and generally struggle with motivation and lately because of recently being diagnosed, with eating.¬†


Nonetherless, it has helped me with getting things done, so I ended up with weekends completely free.¬†


I've found out the best way to cook (for one) is to just buy things If you're going to use them (if you're not disabled or have shops near you). If I had made any big shopping this month I wouldn't have eaten any of it.¬†


Also making things in bulk and freezing, like tomato sauce, soups, broths, old bananas for banana making, and generally things whose texture doesn't matter much.¬† || Travel. I have family in other countries who are quite elderly and so if I don't go to them to see them, I will never see them. They will soon no longer be with the living. I've justified it as I travel taking public transit and packing the lightest possible (hat tip r/HerOneBag ) so as to reduce the allotment of fuel necessary to move me to beloved elders as much as possible, and if I kept traveling like that for the rest of all of their lives, I still wouldn't do as much environmental destruction as AI does in a single day. So given as how I'm a rounding error, I'm going to do the human thing and connect. || You mention that you believe your waste and recycling is all thrown together then separated again at the waste management site. I work in the waste and recycling industry (in Canada) and would be really surprised if that was the case. When residents separate materials and they're collected separately, it's much less expensive for the municipality to deal with AND it's easier to sell the recyclables to markets (they're typically less contaminated). So it's definitely worth separating them at your home! But I agree that reduction is far more important than recycling. 

I'm frustrated with all plastic food packaging too - that's what I struggle with most. I try my best to shop in bulk, but it's far more convenient to go to my local grocery store and life is busy. 

For biowaste, you could try vermicomposting! No odors if you're doing it right, and it makes wonderful fertilizer for plants.

Need help,"We've had posts/threads on shampoo bars here on the subreddit lately and it doesn't take much Google searching for me to find posts upon posts on greenwashing and its evils.

When I came back to shampoo bars, I got Kitsch shampoo and conditioner bars. Having learned how they're a greenwashing brand, I have since become conflicted on purchasing more when I do run out. I want my haircare to continue being sustainable, however, I feel my option are pretty limited since with our hard water my hair really doesn't like soap-based shampoo bars (which are the only ones sold locally to me).

I have a few options in mind and need help picking the least bad out of them (there's no store in my area that allows you to refill shampoo and conditioner as far as I know):

1. Continue using Kitsch (I like how their shampoo bars are sulfate-free, which my scalp really likes), use leave-in conditioner packaged in plastic (I find my hair needs leave-in conditioner after shower)
2. Get shampoo bar, conditioner bar, and leave-in detangler from Rainwater Botanicals. They're located two states north of where I am and while their detangler is shipped in a glass bottle, they don't offer refills and recycling glass is extremely energy and carbon intensive.
3. Be a hypocrite and order shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner/detangler from A Simple Planet, company that has refills and is all for circular economy, but super into clean beauty (which I dislike with a passion since clean beauty products haven't worked for me in the past)
4. Bite the bullet and go back to liquid/regular shampoo and conditioner and silicones.","How I would look at it would be to narrow things down to options that a) are effective enough for your situation (i.e., not the soap-based bars) and b) are above average in terms of sustainability (i.e., not the the standard shampoos in small plastic bottles). From there you can pick based on which company you want to support. 

Even if a company is not doing everything you want sustainability-wise, by supporting them by buying their products you're making it more likely they can grow and put money into setting up things like a refill program (assuming they do continue to follow their stated values as they grow). What I think a lot of people get tripped up by is trying to estimate exactly how sustainable a product is when lack of research/tracking and the number of factors involve make it basically impossible. 

Personally, I'm happy using either Hibar or Ethique bars (which for me can be found locally at Whole Foods or Ulta). But if the best someone can do while also keeping their hair happy is to reduce plastic by buying shampoo in extra large bottles instead of small bottles, then that's also perfectly valid. || Finish what you have! That‚Äôs the most zero waste answer! When you do that; I really really like the HiBar brand of solid shampoo and conditioner bars! || A perfect solution rarely available to any of us in any consumable product. As you are doing, we try to weigh the options available and make the best decisions we think we can make. The ‚Äúgreenwash‚Äù economy is rampant, but we have to be careful not to let the ‚Äúgood‚Äù become the enemy of the ‚Äúperfect.‚Äù If you have found a low waste product (shampoo bar, etc.) that works for you, and doesn‚Äôt leave a major plastic footprint every month, go with that. As conscientious consumers, we can make the best choices available to us, knowing that every product has an impact. I try to be very mindful of my product choices, including their packaging and shipping impacts, and make the best decision available to me. It may not be perfect or ideologically ‚Äúpure‚Äù on every front, but I do my best. I think that is all the available to any of us. Good luck. 

By the way, do you have a refill store near you? My refill store has liquid shampoos, conditioners, dish soaps, etc. I personally use shampoo and conditioner bars, but there are options in my community to refill a lot of liquid consumable products. || Do you have a local farmers market? || I love Chagrin Valley herbs shampoo bars. Family owned company from Ohio. I've heard good things about Rainwater Botanicals and they've been around for many years, but I haven't tried their products. || 4. 

It's reasonable to try other options and determine if they're a success or a failure. But eventually you have to recognize that the amount of effort you've put into one, ONE personal care product is not worth it. You can still make better choices with liquid shampoo in bottles, such as more environmentally friendly, animal safe, more natural ingredients, etc. || I have used Lum√© body bars on my hair.  Works fine. I'm not sure it is not soap based. The gel also works. || Check out Humby Organics.  I love their shampoo bars!

Reusable Floss Pick,"I‚Äôm going on a 3-month road trip and I‚Äôm looking for a zero-low waste way to floss. I have MASSIVE hands and a TINY mouth so flossing like the dentist doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôve been using ‚Äúbiodegradable‚Äù picks but they probably don‚Äôt actually biodegrade.

I found the Dental Lace floss that I want to purchase but not something to use as a replacement for the actual floss picks. I know Quip used to make one but it was discontinued. I‚Äôm seeing some on Amazon but a lot of them are plastic. 

Does anyone have any recommendations for something I can check out? Thank you love you.","It's not a perfect solution - but I use wooden tooth picks. || I bought 2 stainless steel flossers off Aliexpress, but hey show discontinued and I haven't been able to find them again to order more for my kids.

You might be able to hunt it down, I didn‚Äôt try too hard. || This is going to sound like an advertisement, but I have a tiny mouth and like good tension on my floss. I have been through a lot of floss pick holders. If you are willing to use two hands to do your tiny mouth flossing, I found a set of slender metal doohickies that hold the floss as if they were fingers that can go into your mouth and as each is held independently in a separate hand, you can pull that floss as tight as you want. The metal doohickies are longer than I expected but they are packed for my next travel adventure in place of all the other floss holders I have tried previously because of that tight floss tension.

I have previously tried: quip floss holder (good tension with quip official floss, bad tension with anything else), Butler Gum Y shaped plastic stick (good tension for a while but then the floss unwinds itself from the wheel and bye bye tension, also, uses a lot of floss per stringing), some 3D printed floss pick looking apparatuses (tension just wasn't there for the whole mouth), The Mister's Slate flosser (while each floss head was reusable for days on end, the thing is bulky to pack, it is expensive, and eventually those floss heads are trash)

Ratios for Dr. Bronners as a laundry soap?,"After the last 3 years of me being unable to reduce waste like I used to- I‚Äôm back on the journey of cutting down everywhere I can. I switched from gain to the sensitive skin friendly detergents but I hate buying those giant plastic jugs. 

I‚Äôd like to be able to reuse one of the smaller detergent jugs I‚Äôve saved & fill it with a premixed ratio with dr bronners for laundry soap? 

I‚Äôm not sure if that makes sense. I was just curious what a good soap:water ratio would be so that I don‚Äôt have to measure out 2-3 tbsp when I go to the laundromat every week? 

Every recipe I see is just what people add into the washer üôÇ 

Could I do 2-3 tbsp and then mix that with enough water to fill a laundry detergent measuring cup? TIA for any insight if anyone else has done this!","I highly discourage using soap as detergent. It caused build up on my washer, and left white patchy marks all over my darker clothes, like a bad sweat stain but in random places.¬†

Soap requires actual agitation, like the old washing boards. Modern washing machines are built for detergent. Destroying a machine is far less eco friendly than years of even the worst detergent.¬† || Powdered detergent in cardboard boxes is what Reddit usually considers the most ecological option. It's even less wasteful than Dr bronners due to the lack of a plastic bottle. You might need to dissolve it in a small amount of warm water if it doesn't dissolve in your water. || don‚Äôt do it. it can void the warranty on your machine. 

i got a bucket of nellie‚Äôs at costco and split it with people. || First, why?

I'm a soapmaker and one niche is the chemistry and differences. Does Dr Bronners make a laundry soap? Don't use skin soap for laundry, they are not interchangeable. Cleansing ratios and things like glycerin amounts or superfat level (stark differences here between hand crafted and commercial options too here) for gentle on skin aren't compatible with string cleansing. They're literally diametrically opposed.

If you want to make laundry soap, use a laundry based bar like Zote. I have made laundry soap (with my own soap) but prefer detergent here. I do make laundry stain stick bars. Lots of instructions on diy laundry soap recipes. Vinegar will help wash soap out fully, best to put in rinse cycle and can be a natural fabric softener as a result. Some people claim vinegar destroys washer seals, so ymmv but I use every laundry cycle.

Synthetic detergents are made up of surfactants. All soap is surfactant, not all surfactants are soap. Commercial liquid products are rarely soap (an oil + lye product) but rather synthetic detergents like body wash. What works for skin is a separate debate, including allergies and sensitivities and not just pH products. Sensitive skin syndets even my dermatologist recommended failed, hand crafted soap helped heal my skin and remove steroids from daily requirements.

Also, any time you add water to something you're adding possibility to grow nasties. If you dilute, preservatives currently present can no longer maintain. Treat as food or learn to add preservatives. Surfactants remove things be decreasing surface tension so they wash off, they don't prevent growth. Antimicrobial addition to soaps are also their own topic. (difference between added for on skin action, vs preservatives preventing bottle growth) || It not made to clean clothes || Don‚Äôt do it. You‚Äôll get far better results with an actual laundry detergent. Get a powder, a concentrated liquid (Dirty Labs has one in aluminum and the bottles are small, which would also be great for taking to laundromat), or tablets like (Blueland and the unscented company both make them, possibly others too). || I‚Äôd recommend a powder detergent, such at Nellie‚Äôs || Whole Foods has a very effective powdered detergent that comes in a cardboard box. It contains the right mix of enzymes for cleaning, and is scent free, and in my experience doesn't flare the sensitive skin havers in my family. '365 Unscented Powdered Laundry Detergent' is the name, it's the only thing I buy at Whole Foods. Don't waste your time ""mixing"" laundry products, just use an effective one with recyclable paper packaging. || Sals suds is excellent for laundry. Rinses out easily. Goes a long way and is excellent for dishes, surfaces, mopping etc. Don't use regular dr bronners on your clothes. || It doesn‚Äôt appear that there is a specific ratio according to Jeeves, a fourth generation dry cleaner in NY.

What to replace parchment paper with?,"Hi! So I bought beeswax wrap to seal my open bowls, plates, cans with as well as wrap my bread in. Basically replacing aluminum foil completely, but I read that beeswax wrap cannot go in the oven or air fryer. I use beeswax to separate frozen food because it does fine in the freezer. 

But I use parchment paper for baking and in my air fryer. I do have silicone baking mats, but none that fit in my air fryer (I could look for one maybe?)

 I find that some thing I bake do not cook as fast / don‚Äôt get the desired crunchy texture when I use silicone mats vs parchment paper. My homemade granola will not cook with silicone and I have other examples, too. 

Is there something I can replace parchment paper with besides silicone mats for things that need to crunch? ","There are silicone air fryer mats, some are cut to fit.

high heat / broiling might still need foil, but using parchment whenever you can cuts down on waste.

Suggestions/issues to write to companies about their products not being zero waste or environmentally friendly?,Hello!! I am wanting to write some emails to some major companies about their products not being zero waste or environmentally friendly and I would like to hear some ideas on a few things to help make a larger impact on these issues. I would love to hear suggestions on companies to write to and what their product(s) are and ways that they could make their stuff more environmentally friendly. One example that got me thinking to do this is contacting some deodorant companies that are not zero waste and asking if they can make something like refillable deodorants or why they don‚Äôt and to even send back pros and cons to their company doing so. Any other suggestions or comments on the matter would also help and be hugely appreciated!!!! ,"[deleted] || Thank you for your work, reducing waste at the source is easily the best way to reduce it completely. it's far easier for a company to swap a production process than convince a population to change its behaviour.

Consider replacing products you use with zero waste options, and then contacting the relevant companies and tell them why you switched away. Companies will pay most attention to departing customers. Encourage friends and family to do the same to increase impact. 

Maybe also consider making some social media accounts for the swaps, and promote replacement zero waste products directly targeting/tagging lines made by non-zero-waste manufacturers, so the social media reports mention consumer groups encouraging people to switch away for that particular reason. From my experience with activism, most organisations consider Twitter the defacto social media still, so would target there first and others second.

However, if you chose that route you're also going to run into a few issues. First off many multinationals will own both the regular brands and the eco alternative lines, so they capture revenue streams from both sides, and do not mind if consumers are being encouraged to switch from one to the other. Make sure to be recommending products that are comparable price point wise, and made by a completely different parent company. Also make sure the products are actually comparable, fluoride free toothpaste is not equivalent to real toothpaste even in a reusable container. And finally, the biggest issue, large brands are incentivized to use large amounts of plastics because the people on the boards are also usually board members of companies who want to sell plastic. They will only ever want to reduce plastic as much as they are legally required to, maybe a couple of extra percent more for marketing material. I haven't got a good workaround for that one, it sounds like a lot of boring research work and I think it might be. || I bought a U-Konserve stainless steel food container to try and replace some of my aging plastic ones, and it came in a plastic coated cardboard box like so so many products do, which makes cardboard, the most basic, most recyclable material, trash. I was pissed and wrote them a nastygram, made sure to mention it in my online review. Heard nothing, but, I do this fairly often and sometimes I‚Äôve actually gotten results. So packaging is a good one to hit on. I think it should be in the product description what packaging it comes in so I can avoid laminated boxes (no thanks Apple anything) and styrofoam at a bare minimum. || I emailed my vegan protein powder company, suggesting that they only include plastic scoops in their small packages and not the big ones (which would be more likely ordered by repeat customers who know they like that flavour). They said, ""....unfortunately, at the moment, we cannot include scoops for some people and not for others. That said, we have been thinking of ways to be able to achieve this and are currently looking into our options. We want to make sure that it will be accessible and easy for customers while still being logistically friendly for our packing team. Therefore, your feedback is greatly appreciated."" || In the US, Trader Joe‚Äôs uses an insane amount of plastic for their produce. They could easily just not wrap their zuchinni in plastic wrap or bag their cucumbers.¬†",4,ZeroWaste,2025-07-13 05:59:17,suggestions issues write companies products zero waste environmentally friendly,hello wanting write emails major companies products zero waste environmentally friendly would like hear ideas things help make larger impact issues would love hear suggestions companies write product ways could make stuff environmentally friendly one example got thinking contacting deodorant companies zero waste asking make something like refillable deodorants even send back pros cons company suggestions comments matter would also help hugely appreciated,deleted thank work reducing waste source easily best way reduce completely far easier company swap production process convince population change behaviour consider replacing products use zero waste options contacting relevant companies tell switched away companies pay attention departing customers encourage friends family increase impact maybe also consider making social media accounts swaps promote replacement zero waste products directly targeting tagging lines made non zero waste manufacturers social media reports mention consumer groups encouraging people switch away particular reason experience activism organisations consider twitter defacto social media still would target first others second however chose route also going run issues first many multinationals regular brands eco alternative lines capture revenue streams sides mind consumers encouraged switch one make sure recommending products comparable price point wise made completely different parent company also make sure products actually comparable fluoride free toothpaste equivalent real toothpaste even reusable container finally biggest issue large brands incentivized use large amounts plastics people boards also usually board members companies want sell plastic ever want reduce plastic much legally required maybe couple extra percent marketing material got good workaround one sounds like lot boring research work think might bought u konserve stainless steel food container try replace aging plastic ones came plastic coated cardboard box like many products makes cardboard basic recyclable material trash pissed wrote nastygram made sure mention online review heard nothing fairly often sometimes actually gotten results packaging good one hit think product description packaging comes avoid laminated boxes thanks apple anything styrofoam bare minimum emailed vegan protein powder company suggesting include plastic scoops small packages big ones would likely ordered repeat customers know like flavour said unfortunately moment cannot include scoops people others said thinking ways able achieve currently looking options want make sure accessible easy customers still logistically friendly packing team therefore feedback greatly appreciated us trader joe uses insane amount plastic produce could easily wrap zuchinni plastic wrap bag cucumbers
Update on New Year‚Äôs Resolution - Six Months Progress,"Hi y'all,

I'm back with my sixth month of progress towards my New Year's Resolution of living more Zero Waste.

Here's [January](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1in9a97/update_on_new_years_resolution_one_month_progress/), [February](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1j2ryf6/update_on_new_years_resolution_two_months_progress/), [March](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1jqrq13/update_on_new_years_resolution_three_months/), [April](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1kp5ivv/update_on_new_years_resolution_four_months/), and [May](https://www.reddit.com/r/ZeroWaste/comments/1l3addv/update_on_new_years_resolution_five_months/).

Not a ton going on this month, but I suppose that makes sense. It's not really about reviewing all the newest zero waste products. It's just about finding solutions that meet my needs.

Swapped this month:

* Swapped to a wood pencil eyeliner. Honestly I don't love the one I got but it's decent enough. I'll finish it before trying another. It did have a plastic cap and safety seal on it, but I don't think it's possible to find one without that.
* Cotton wash-cloths. Previously I was using loofah sponges (the actual gourd, not the plastic ones). Those are also of course plastic free, but they do wear out over time and go in the compost (a long time, but still eventually). They also were just too abrasive for everyday use. I got a pack of cotton washcloths and am much happier with them. It's kinda funny the trajectory of shower scrubbers I've taken in my life. As a kid, my whole family used wash cloths, then we all switched to those plastic loofahs when I was in middle school. I used those for many years, as well as all manner of other plastic scrubber contraptions (exfoliating gloves/mits/those big sponges/etc). Then a couple years back I wanted to reduce my plastic waste so I got a big pack of actual loofahs, and now I've circled all the way back around to the humble wash cloth lol.

Seeking recommendations:

* Leave-in conditioner/curl cream for fine/\~2b hair
* Face lotion

Swaps I decided I won't be making:

* Tooth paste. I deal with tooth sensitivity and dry mouth, so I use Sensodyne and a medicated mouth rinse (recommended by my dentist.). I haven't seen any zero waste products that seem like they will meet those needs.
* Sunscreen. I am extremely fair and burn very easily. As you can imagine, skin cancer is also very prevalent in my family. I could not find much research that had been done on the safety and efficacy of the various zero waste packaging materials. Frankly, I don't want to risk trying one only for the SPF to completely degrade in a couple weeks.

Shout-outs this month:

* My local Buy Nothing group. I was talking recently with friends who live in other places and learned just how friendly and active the one in my area is by comparison. So yeah, just feeling very grateful for them.

Thanks everyone for following along and as always for your recommendations! I really appreciate them.","For face lotion and sunscreen I really like the company called Krave Beauty, the CEO is on youtube and has spoken out about always trying to select the most ecological ingredients and packaging. I have been using them for a long time as well and can recommend the quality, kravebeauty.com || Honestly I use straight avocado oil for face moisturizer. I also wash with the oil cleansing method, grapeseed and castor blend. I keep the avocado in a tiny spritz bottle, and spritz into my hand. Refill bottle from avocado oil can/bottle!

I also use oils and butters for skin and hair. You can also use good quality lotion directly on hair, but I have a different type. Milk vs lotion vs cream are all oil in water products and vary based on the amount of oil to water. Mango butter is excellent for skin, and ""drier"" feeling. Cocoa, shea, coconut, and olive are common hair oils. Jojoba oil is the closest ""oil"" to human sebum and argan is a other popular hair oil. || For SS, I like the Badger solid ones in the tin. For lotion- are you totally against using oil? I‚Äôve found facial oil is just as good for *me* and then SS- done! || Try the brand akamaibasics.com for face lotion and mineral tooth powder and maybe also give skyandsol.co a try for moisturiser and sunscreen. Another sunscreen I would recommend is freaksofnature.com. Good luck on your journey. You‚Äôre on the right path. || Kitsch has leave in conditioner I like (plus it smells pretty!) And as far as curl cream, I'm 2c and have yet to find a super sustainable option, but the closest I've got was using prose. They're pretty expensive so I only do the curl cream not their shampoo/conditioner (I use bars for that from ethique!) but you take a quiz about your hair type and preferences, then they do a custom formula. Its small batch and the bottles are *technically* recyclable so its better than a lot of bs out there! || I was using Prose, but found it to be expensive. I switched my shampoo and conditioner to Everist and I love it. Its concentrated,  so you only need a little and they come in metal tubes or tins. I have fine, oily, wavy hair. I recently made my own leave in/sea salt spray by adding the conditioner, some sea salt and filling with water. I just spray, style and air dry.  It works well on my short hair. I found creams and oils left my hair heavy and greasy.

How to dispose of large amount of bleach,"Acting on advice from a friend, I killed a bunch of maggots in my garbage can using a combination of bleach and water.

What‚Äôs my best option?","Bleach is super easy to dispose of. Like another commenter said, it breaks down into salt and water. Sunlight will break it down faster. || Bleach denatures into salt and water. Let it sit in the bin for a bit then rinse it with plenty of water into your yard or gutter.¬† || You can dilute it down and flush it no problemo || Your toilet should be able to handle the maggots, if you want to dump it right away || Per the [Clorox website ](https://www.clorox.com/learn/how-to-neutralize-bleach-with-hydrogen-peroxide/), you can neutralize bleach with hydrogen peroxide. || Boiling water next time also kills maggots! || next time just use vinegar. 

vinegar is a much safer alternative to bleach in just about every use case.

edit: do not mix bleach and vinegar. it will produce chlorine gas. another reason to not use bleach in a situation like this. a little sugary water in the bottom of that recycling bin on a hot day will quickly become an acid, which will react with bleach to make chlorine gas. 

pretty much every time i open a recycling bin i get a whiff of funky fermentation.

*unless you‚Äôre cleaning up bodily fluids, bleach is overkill.*

there are so so many alternative cleaning solutions that don‚Äôt bring with them the risks and environmental costs of using bleach. || If it happens again, just use boiling water. That's what I did. Killed the maggots quick, no chemicals to worry about. Just let it cool off before throwing it on the grass or down the drain. Then after, use a little bit of dish soap, and some hot water to scrub it clean like you would clean anything else. A small amount of dawn should be safe for your lawn.

simple swaps that actually stuck. what‚Äôs working for you?,switched to compostable dish scrubbers and solid soap bars a year ago. zero packaging waste and still holding up fine. curious what else folks have swapped that just quietly works?,"Cloth towels in place of paper towels. Cloth napkins in place of paper napkins. Flannel baby blankets cut down to small squares in place of kleenex. Insulated water tumbler instead of plastic water bottles. Reusable bags for shopping. Bar soap for body wash. || Sadly not a lot of things have stuck. I had to switch back to a normal shampoo and conditioner for the health of my hair and a prescription toothpaste for my teeth. Ethique stopped making lotion concentrate so I'm back to the tubs and I can hardly afford any zero waste makeup anymore. My compost didn't work, which makes sense because I live in an apartment and just had a bin on my balcony lol 

Small things have stuck though. I do have Elate's refillable pallets which will probably last me forever because of how little makeup I wear. I still buy Blueland's soap tablets and the cleaner concentrates from Grove. I purchase teas in bulk that come in metal cans as opposed to the plastic tea bags. Aquaphor in little glass jars instead of chapsticks all over the house. I try and cut down on food waste whenever I can and always choose the best packaging when possible. Recycle whatever I can. || Reusable menstrual products! So many great reusable alternatives exist, I don‚Äôt even know why people are still using disposables. I‚Äôm a reusable disc and cloth pad girly üòä || Bought a couple big loofahs... cut a slice off and use for doing dishes, scrubbing literally anything... I'll never go back to any other product. ( I don't have a dishwasher, all done by hand )

That alongside sals suds( by Dr bronners ) and I'm all set for dishes laundry floors counters etc. If only sals suds came in a carton or something but I buy the big gallon and then keep the jug for various other uses || Sal Suds as a concentrated, biodegradable all-purpose detergent. It works well for my moderately hard water area. I use it as a dish cleaner, laundry detergent, pressure washer fluid, windshield wiper fluid, window cleaner, all purpose spray, etc. One US Gallon of this stuff takes over the task of so many different cleaners and it lasts forever.  

That and washable/reusable HVAC filters by ReAir || Reusable grocery bags, collecting water from shower heating up to water plants, reusable baking sheet liner and hang drying clothes || Composting. We take out less trash and buy less fertilizer. It's daunting to start. r/composting is a good resource. We live in a city with a small yard where it doesn't get too hot. We started composting before we even started our garden. We could probably expand since what we make is not enough for our tiny 8x4 garden. || I carry stainless steel straws and cutlery. Cloth shopping bags. And minimal wardrobe pieces. || 1. i switched to castile bar soap for more things than you‚Äôd think:
‚Ä¢ washing myself (the obvious one)
‚Ä¢ i broke some down with water (it was difficult, but i literally ended up with a milk jug of goop from one bar‚Ä¶ you have to grate it up and mix it with hot water) and that milk jug has lasted literally forever. i pour a bit into a recycled spray bottle (maybe 1/4 of the bottle) and then i add essential oils (lemon, lavender, lemongrass, orange, and rosemary) and then i fill the rest with warm water. it makes the best all purpose spray i have ever used!!! i prefer it to the ‚Äòorganic‚Äô all purpose sprays my mom buys that come in plastic bottles!

2. i compost in one of those compost tumblers that you can spin. as it‚Äôs gotten heavier, it‚Äôs a bit harder to spin, so i may try using piles soon. i will say it hasn‚Äôt stunk at all and i haven‚Äôt had pest issues. r/composting helped me a lot

3. i got reusable makeup removers from aldis and i use them for my toner or to remove makeup. i do think that they would be easy to make if you could sew, but i haven‚Äôt needed to as mine have already lasted well over a year and look brand new. 

4. i started mending my clothing. or if i have an item i don‚Äôt love anymore, but i like the fabric, i reuse it to make something else. so much of what we give to goodwill and stuff like that gets thrown away, so if you can find another use (even as rags) for items, that‚Äôs the best way to go. 

5. this is prob the most weird thing i‚Äôll list, but i save all the bones from the food my family eats and put them in the freezer to later make bone broth for my dog. i put them in a crock pot for a whole day and then i strain out then crush the bones and add it back to the liquid. it saves food waste and gives my fur baby extra calcium.

6. i save the fat from beef when making things like tacos, render it (you can find info on youtube) and then save it in a jar to make soap and body butters. it has no smell after you render it. || [removed] || We grew loofas last year and have been using them for dish sponges.

Alternative to string trimmers for weed whacking?,"I have an electric mower, which I love, and am looking on facebook marketplace for used string trimmers but I REALLY don't like that they're literally creating microplastic everywhere... by design. You replace the plastic string and it shreds down, into everything and you feed in more line - over and over over and over again

I'm also fully invested in native plants, have a massive lot that I cleared with hundreds of plants, dozens of trees, all native and doing great so far. we have an acre and slowly but surely it's going to become a native plant garden paradise. I dont use any chemicals in my lawn etc, but there are a few spots where a weed whacker would really do the trick....I just hate them. 

What I really need is some sort of easy tool that doesn't throw plastic everywhere that I can use to clear random spots of invasive weeds - a spot my mower cant hit along a fence, spots up against the house, edges, etc. The metal bladed brush clearing blades could maybe work, but most of what I'm trying to trim is along the sides of stuff like fencing or my house that I can't just destroy with a spinning blade. ","I use grass shears. You can even find long-handled rolling ones. || Not cheap and may not work for really tight spots but maybe a scythe? You can also buy shorter blades for woodier/smaller areas. We use it to mow grass, even up to our fence. Austrian company Schroekenfux makes very high quality ones, they can be re-sharpened by hand until there‚Äôs practically nothing left. Handle is made from wood. IMO it‚Äôs an extremely enjoyable activity especially since it makes no noise/no uncomfortable vibration from a motor. But not sure if it‚Äôll work for your specific needs.¬† || They make wire headed ones, would that work better instead of the metal blade ones?

Vent: Thoughts on a Keurig coffee maker with reusable pod,"Hey all, 

My Dad has a Keurig at his house, which I've half-jokingly called ""the environmental atrocity"" since I was a teenager. 

Lately when I visit Dad though, I find myself eyeing the Keurig in a new way. Now that I'm older and busier, I really enjoy the simplicity of pressing a button and getting a hot cup for one. The little Mr. Coffee at my apartment takes forever, makes too much coffee, and I end up throwing some away. I've tried Aeropress and other approaches like weighing my coffee over the years, but I'm ultimately not a coffee ritual person, and what I'm liking about Dad's Keurig is the ease. 

I will say that I studied ecology and conservation in school and grad school, and worked in ocean conversation nonprofits after that. 

Through a decade in conservation work, I learned 1) that awareness-raising conservation nonprofits are often poorly run and you shouldn't meet your heroes, and 2) that a handful of brands like Nestle are responsible for the vast majority of pollution and emissions through their supply chains. Now I have a really hard time with the notion that consumers should take personal responsibility for the burden of saving the environment. In many ways, the popularization of that idea in the media is just another marketing technique to take responsibility off of these companies and put it on the consumer. 

If just one of these brands shut down or never existed we could all drive Hummers and not worry about climate change. Not to mention that the palm oil and other mass-produced ingredients in commercial ""green"" food products lead to clear-cutting rainforest and ultimately killing species like Orangutans rather than chicken or cattle. I feel like there's no win except to hold a handful of mega-companies accountable, which isn't happening lately. 

So I feel weird about wanting a Keurig. Maybe the reusable pod would make it better. Maybe I'm just burned out. Erg. ","Very possible to be both burnt out and right about a Keurig type coffee maker being a better fit for you! 

I see second hand Keurig available all the time (thrift stores and Buy Nothing community groups alike) so you could acquire one without personally giving Keurig money for the design that creates waste. There are also coffee maker brands that can grind beans and brew individual cups of coffee if you want a *new* maker that‚Äôs less plastic-focused

And I am also so frustrated and discouraged by knowing how much of the blame is on large corporations ‚Äì it would feel easier to me if it was just up to personal responsibility!! That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve aged into being even more policy-focused and trying to ‚Äòvote with my dollar‚Äô, since consumers alone can‚Äôt fix the problem. I see my personal responsibility to find the most sustainable (two meanings) life I can live that doesn‚Äôt burn me out because I‚Äôm feeling guilty about a plastic hummus tub, while also directing energy into supporting and advocating-for policies that will reign in the biggest polluters. We can do both if we play our cards right ‚Äì and are fueled by plenty of nice coffee. I hope you find a good coffee maker for yourself! || Used Keurig + reusable pods filled with your coffee of choice || french press or moka pots are the best ! || Our office upgraded from a kurig to a one cup moccamaster brewer¬†


They cost a lot but have better build quality, are easier to maintain, and the company sells replacement parts


They also make much much better tasting coffee


You can occasionally find them second hand



https://us.moccamaster.com/products/cup-one?variant=40378073514147


Edit: company sells them referbished https://us.moccamaster.com/collections/moccamaster-refurbished-products/products/moccamaster-cup-one-refurbished?variant=42625605370019 || I got a Keurig secondhand and use refillable pods, it's been pretty great. It's okay to choose convenience sometimes, and I think this is a really good middle ground. I was always a one-cup kind of guy and would also waste a lot of coffee, which I feel horrible about because that's not nothing! People worked hard to harvest that! It's damned if you do, damned if you don't - but if you use a secondhand product and reusable pods, you're creating less waste than if you kept making extra batches of coffee and pouring some down the drain. || I had a Keurig with a reusable pod, I loved it, you save so much money on coffee. Pods are expensive, and making  full pots was so wasteful. The reusable pod you literally just rinse and reuse. || I've got a small French press. It's great. It makes one medium sized mugs worth of coffee. By the time it's steeped and pressed it's cooled enough for me to drink it black right away at the perfect temperature. I've never used a reusable Keurig pod, but I can't imagine a French press is any harder to clean. Plus, no risk of mold build up with a French press.¬† || I‚Äôll be the one to break the bad news about K-cup coffees‚Ä¶ the convenience is NOT worth the taste, even with your own coffee. I used to have one and it literally always had a burnt plastic taste to it, and the coffee was never strong enough. Honestly, if you‚Äôre struggling with making enough coffee for an individual cup, I personally am a fan of instant coffee. There are still some brands that sell in glass jars too. It‚Äôs always strong enough and you can use the little crystals to make coffee flavored things too. Some people might turn up their nose at it but tbh, it does the job quite well especially if you are putting cream and sugar in it. || Do not get a Keurig. Weigh that tempting convenience against the much bigger inconvenience of trying to clean up the whole damn planet. 

>Now I have a really hard time with the notion that consumers should take personal responsibility for the burden of saving the environment.

Repeat this as your daily mantra: 

It is not a zero sum game. Consumers can and should take personal responsibility for our choices, our actions, and the debt we owe to future generations. There is no law that says we alone are responsible, and the big polluters are off the hook. 

We can be responsible individuals and still demand and agitate for major policy changes. 

The biggest error activists make is to set up false either/or choices. 

> || If you do pull the plug and get one, they have reusable k-cups you just fill, use, dump the grounds (trash or composting) and rinse. It takes seconds to do and takes no thought. It gives the ease of the ‚Äúhit a button and go‚Äù without the overwhelming plastic waste.

We also got camping filters for our coffee and tea.  Just a filter with a lid that fits over a mug which brews the coffee straight in the mug with hot water. It takes a few minutes and you can use whatever grounds you want and make it as strong as you want. || The reusable pods are ok but will make weak coffee on the larger brew setting unless you grind the grounds very fine.

It's easy to make a pot with a French press or Mr coffee and refrigerate the leftovers so you can make a pot every couple or few days.  I keep a measuring cup near the coffee so it's two scoops instead of >8 tbsps to measure, and the pot is graduated for easy filling. || If you can afford it, Breville / Sage (same company, different branding globally) has great easy coffee machines without pods.

I would say, however, they are pitched more at the coffee connoisseurs but do the math on life time over priced pods vs upfront machine cost.

You don‚Äôt have to be a snob to appreciate a higher quality than dunkin/holiday inn coffee which is about as good as Keurig gets.

I will however agree I welcome their convenience in a hotel rather than nothing or having to go to the lobby. || Honestly they break down a lot‚Ä¶. I like my French press a lot! 
Also, how does one go about finding, and getting a job at an environmental company, non profit etc! || I have a secondhand one (hand me down from my cousin) with reusable pods.  USe it every day.

It meets my needs.  I don't need or want anything fancier. || My dad exclusively uses the reusable pod. This is mostly because my mom doesn‚Äôt drink coffee though and he doesn‚Äôt drink more than 1 cup at a time || We used one with reusable pods at my old work! It was fantastic. || For ultimate ease, have you considered instant coffee (I get it from Aldi) and an electric kettle? I've been doing that for two years and won't be looking back anytime soon. It tastes 60% as good for 8% of the price, and I LOVE that I can adjust how strong my coffee is with complete ease. I also get Aldi's decaf and mix the two depending on time of day. || I bought a Keurig with Dave and Busters tickets about 10 years ago. The reusable pods are easy to use for coffee. But my favorite use is just boiling water! Much faster and easier than a kettle. And I can heat up specific volumes so I if I need to dissolve bouillon in some water for a recipe, I‚Äôm all set! || Grabbing cold brew in the morning is even easier. Glass + pour. Making it is easy too. Day before, add grounds to water. Presto. || Former barista here - aside from how horrible they are for the planet, pod coffee is a bad idea from a coffee perspective.

When it comes to good coffee, the things that matter most, in order of importance, are . . . 

1) Water quality (coffee is 99% water)
2) Freshness of grind (fresh ground is always gonna taste better, even with shit beans versus great)
3) Freshness of roast
4) Bean quality, etc

Pods guarantee 2 and 3 are going to be bad, because the coffee is ground long before you brew it.

Get a grinder, a french press, and an electric kettle.  You can get a smart one that you setup to bring water to a boil when you wake up.  You'll need to wait no more than 5 minutes for a much, much better cup of coffee.",32,ZeroWaste,2025-07-09 21:03:22,vent thoughts keurig coffee maker reusable pod,hey dad keurig house half jokingly

"Can I fix this without buying a new tip and throwing this out? I don't want to waste the rubber that is still there, but it does need a base.","It is my first walking stick. It's helped me get around so much. But it's been a month of frequent use and... the tip is already eroded. The metal sticks out from the rubber. It makes a loud noise. I don't want to waste the rubber that is still there.            

I can crochet but I doubt wool would last long. I have jute rope I could try. I have been experimenting with crocheting with other materials.            ","This is for your safety. A new rubber tip for your cane is something you need - like water. || I agree with others, don‚Äôt sacrifice the metal of the cane or your own health and safety for this tip. Get a replacement tip and soon. 

Longer term, maybe look into more sustainable made tips, like maybe bamboo? But the resources saved trying to skimp on this cane tip will be used up in a single hospital trip if you have a bad fall. It‚Äôs okay to put your health and safety first on this one || I understand the desire, but if this is a mobility aid you really should just bite the bullet and get a new one. The absolutely most acceptable for of plastic waste is always for medical/health/disability reasons. There is a reason they are made of rubber, it provides traction, stability, and cushion. Also just bc there‚Äôs still rubber left there isn‚Äôt really important. That‚Äôs just to hold it on to the tip. The only part that matters is the bottom of it. 

You can likely find a pack of 2-3 at your hardware store if you want to avoid Amazon (though I‚Äôve occasionally needed to get cane tips there when there aren‚Äôt any helpful options at the store). Technically there‚Äôs a chance they even have a bucket of just loose tips, and you don‚Äôt need to buy one wrapped in plastic. || Putting a coin or washer into the bottom of a new tip will help keep it from cutting through as easily. If there is concern about wear against the end of the tubing, you can try plastic or something like leather, but they might not last as long. We used to put nickels in the ends of our bicycle grips to prevent the handlebars from punching through when we laid them down on the ground. || Buy a new tip for your own health and peace of mind - those are more important than the amount of waste you could avoid. Maybe there are more durable materials for the tip but that‚Äôs something to research AFTER you have a safe walking stick again. || Hi, long term crutch and stick user here.

This is not salvageable, and it is extremely dangerous to even try. 

The rubber ends usually have something like a metal washer in the bottom, so that the tube of the cane doesn't cut through the rubber and do what you see above. You no-longer have that washer. This will cause your cane to skitter on certain surfaces and could cause a very nasty fall. 

You need to replace the rubber stopper as soon as you notice the grip has almost worn away on the bottom. You should not wait for it to get into this situation.

Go to a mobility shop, and they will help you find the right sized stopper. Unfortunately, you have damaged the bottom of the cane itself, and sometimes this can affect which stopper fits, and how quickly the next one wears out. 

This is not an area you can find an alternative for. Your health is important. || Thank you all for the help and advice. I'll buy a new tip, but what can I do with it once it is replaced? If it does continue to wear out every month, I don't want to throw them away if there is something I could use them for. || Throwing away a couple ounces of cracked rubber every month or so seems like a mighty fair price for your health & freedom. Don't set yourself on fire in the name of sustainability. || If you really really really want to save it, here‚Äôs an option: punch out a round disc from an old car tire and glue it on with a strong adhesive like the ones used for shoe repairs. That said, car tires often have metal reinforcements in them, so cutting them isn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds.

It‚Äôs quite a bit of effort and might not be worth it compared to the small downside of replacing the tip. If you do toss it, you could try collecting the rubber bits and bringing them to a place that recycles rubber. Sometimes they shred these materials to use for playground surfaces and similar projects. || A walking stick ferrule is important.  It not only protects the actual stick, it provides grip.

And you need good grip in a walking stick.

There are some uses where plastic really works well.   Ferrules are in that category.

Do you know an alternative for cotton swabs / q-tips for the nose?,"Hey lovelies!

Plastic free/zero waste razors?,"Hi, I'm looking for recommendations for low waste shaving razors that AREN'T safety razors, and I'm having a hard time finding any online. I unfortunately don't feel safe possessing loose blades. I know because of this there will always be some waste/plastic. I'm a little frustrated with myself because this is supposed to be one of the easiest switches to make!","unfortunately any zero waste razor is going to have loose blades. || I don‚Äôt have a product recommendation for you, but will say that it‚Äôs okay to use plastic/disposable items if zero/low waste options don‚Äôt work for you. 

I use a safety razor everywhere except my ankles/lower legs because of all the nicks and scrapes I get. I use a plastic ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù razor for them (bought a bag of them 6ish years ago and slowly working through). But I only shave my legs a few times a month, so 1 plastic razor lasts a year+ since I dry/clean it and store it in a drawer to maximize its lifespan. When it‚Äôs done, I drop it off - along with my used safety razor blades - at a local store to be recycled.

So maybe keep using the razors you currently use, but find a program that will recycle them (Terracycle and Gillette supposedly partnered to recycle any brand of disposable razors). Also see if you can find razors made with recycled plastic. Or just commit to reducing waste in other areas of your life. || You could try an electric razor. The waste would be minimal. || I use a Preserve razor when I travel with just a carry on since I can‚Äôt take my Leaf razor.¬†

Need help deciding which to choose: saving water with potentially greater carbon footprint or potentially lesser carbon footprint with greater water usage in manufacturing,"Love the idea of zero waste, however I only seem to do it with any success in haircare. I recently got back into shampoo and conditioner bars (loved using syndet bars before, they're what I'm using now), but don‚Äôt love the fact that I have to order them. When I used regular shampoo and conditioner, I would buy them in stores in my hometown, though they were packaged in plastic. Which is worse for the environment: using shampoo and conditioner that are packaged in plastic, but don‚Äôt need to be ordered from anywhere or getting shampoo and conditioner bars, but having them shipped from out of state? Which has the greater carbon footprint?","Unless the bars are made in the local store, they're still shipped as is and then kept in a store. Several studies have suggested that delivery services, like Amazon, have lower carbon footprint per item, although I find that dubious. I would personally go the no plastic delivery route because plastic is way harder to reverse than CO2. If the CO2 emissions still bother you, you can donate to plant a tree (or plant one yourself) to offset the purchase. || Ahh, I struggle with these sorts of dilemmas on an everyday basis! I feel you.
I can't answer your question I'm sorry, but wondered if I could suggest a third option? More effort involved on your part, but I wonder if maybe you have some local businesses that would order it in for you? Then you get the product you want, it will be sent in a larger quantity than your individual order so better distributing the carbon offset, and a happy result might be that other buyers might make the switch too!
If you have other like-minded people living near you, you could encourage them to ask the businesses to order in these products too. Gotta show them there's demand! || I choose the no-plastic route every time, and minimize my carbon footprint by buying in bulk. || Do you live in a water scarce region? || My gut feeling: Shipping bars to you (with no/little water content) is probably less carbon than shipping traditional shampoo (lots of heavy water) to the store. Plus no plastic.

Someone is driving to/from your house anyway ‚Äî either you or the delivery driver.

The ideal solution would be a locally made bar, but the ideal isn‚Äôt often available. 

I‚Äôd batch ship several bars at once - whatever quantity makes sense for you - and call it a day. || This has been calculated for my own country (https://agirpourlatransition.ademe.fr/particuliers/conso/mode/calculez-impact-livraison-colis not in english). 

Package delivery is not terrible compared to going to the shop by car though I expect you will not go there just to get shampoo. The plastic from the packaging (3 kg of CO2 per kg of plastic) probably amounts to a very similar CO2 cost that the delivery (around 0,6 kg).

I think in this case the carbon footprint will not make a big difference and you should go with a choice between less plastic or supporting a local business || I've been able to find shampoo/conditioner bars at Target, if you've got one near you. || Online shopping is actually more sustainable than in-person, even if you're taking public transportation, and even more so if the items are shipped via USPS (if you're in the states)! 

The best way to think about it is: all of the products have to be shipped to the store in the first place, plus you have to get to and from the store. Versus ordering something online that ships directly to you in a truck that is already coming to the warehouse it's shipping from and your home every day, in the most optimized way possible. 

There are a ton of studies on it, and I've done a lot of the math and info compiling about it over the years to double and triple check it so if you want me to send you some links I'd be happy to. Most recently I learned that it's significantly less emissions to ship a heavy 1/2 gallon glass jar of something literally as far across the country as possible (and back) than it is for me to drive to the grocery store down the street. It's definitely counter-intuitive, but it's so fascinating once you start diving into it! || You can make your own syndet bars too.  look at humble bee and me for recipes and tweak to your hair type.  it's what I do.  That way I order large-sized ingredients delivered and can make a few years worth of bars for the price and shipping footprint of a few bars delivered. || There's always so many things to consider with these sorts of questions. If you're happy with the bars you're using, here's a few more reasons to keep using them. 1 - If you vote with your dollar, you're helping companies with these sorts of values grow, possibly until they're big enough that they'll be stocked at your local store. But if you don't then the standard products people use will remain. 2 - Assuming the bars come from a company that is truly focused on sustainability, they will be making choices throughout the entire production process to reduce waste and limit environmental process, from how they source the ingredients, to what cleaning products are used in the company's offices. 

In this case, it's very likely that the bars are overall the better options. Most of the time it's not at all clear though, as there's so many factors at play plus companies have never had a reason to track all the details needed to really make the comparisons. There's definitely been studies that try to do this as others have mentioned, but these still have to make a lot of assumptions and the conclusions are about what's better 'on average' (and so may not reflect your particular situation).",10,ZeroWaste,2025-07-09 08:56:28,need help deciding choose saving water potentially greater carbon footprint potentially lesser carbon footprint greater water usage manufacturing,love idea zero waste however seem success haircare recently got back shampoo conditioner bars loved using syndet bars using love fact order used regular shampoo conditioner would buy stores hometown though packaged plastic worse environment using shampoo conditioner packaged plastic need ordered anywhere getting shampoo conditioner bars shipped state greater carbon footprint,unless bars made local store still shipped kept store several studies suggested delivery services like amazon lower carbon footprint per item although find dubious would personally go plastic delivery route plastic way harder reverse co co emissions still bother donate plant tree plant one offset purchase ahh struggle sorts dilemmas everyday basis feel answer question sorry wondered could suggest third option effort involved part wonder maybe local businesses would order get product want sent larger quantity individual order better distributing carbon offset happy result might buyers might make switch like minded people living near could encourage ask businesses order products gotta show demand choose plastic route every time minimize carbon footprint buying bulk live water scarce region gut feeling shipping bars little water content probably less carbon shipping traditional shampoo lots heavy water store plus plastic someone driving house anyway either delivery driver ideal solution would locally made bar ideal often available batch ship several bars whatever quantity makes sense call day calculated country english package delivery terrible compared going shop car though expect go get shampoo plastic packaging kg co per kg plastic probably amounts similar co cost delivery around kg think case carbon footprint make big difference go choice less plastic supporting local business able find shampoo conditioner bars target got one near online shopping actually sustainable person even taking public transportation even items shipped via usps states best way think products shipped store first place plus get store versus ordering something online ships directly truck already coming warehouse shipping home every day optimized way possible ton studies done lot math info compiling years double triple check want send links happy recently learned significantly less emissions ship heavy gallon glass jar something literally far across country possible back drive grocery store street definitely counter intuitive fascinating start diving make syndet bars look humble bee recipes tweak hair type way order large sized ingredients delivered make years worth bars price shipping footprint bars delivered always many things consider sorts questions happy bars using reasons keep using vote dollar helping companies sorts values grow possibly big enough stocked local store standard products people use remain assuming bars come company truly focused sustainability making choices throughout entire production process reduce waste limit environmental process source ingredients cleaning products used company offices case likely bars overall better options time clear though many factors play plus companies never reason track details needed really make comparisons definitely studies try others mentioned still make lot assumptions conclusions better average may reflect particular situation
What‚Äôs the most underrated zero-waste/eco-friendly product you have discovered recently?,"I have been exploring easy eco-swaps that actually work for everyday life. Some of them may not be a 100% zero waste, but they are way more eco-friendly than the conventional stuff.

One product that I swear by these days is bar shampoo with natural soap nut extracts. It comes wrapped in paper, so no more plastic bottles, and it‚Äôs great while travelling.

Would love to hear what others have discovered.","Bicycle - unlocked a different type of movement and joy, powered by whatever I've eaten || Nothing! Seriously.


Everyone is looking for cool gadgets or eco-whatever which can be important with things likr soap you cant eliminate. But the most enviromentally friendly option that seems very underated in these discussions is to reduce or eliminate unessessary usage of things || They're nothing new, but I love my reusable period pads - they're comfortable (more than the disposable ones I used to use), easy to use, and I have had mine for 5 years and they still look brand new, no stains, nothing. I never got on board with the cups - I tried one and didn't like it, and at ¬£30 per cup I am not about to try them to see if a different brand would work for me... 

I was a big solid shampoo fan with Ethique, but I moved and can't find them anymore, will have to try local brands. || Beer bottle tops stuck into my bars of soap, shampoo and conditioner especially for travelling.

I haven‚Äôt bought canned beans since I got it. || Didn't discover recently,¬† discovered 12 years ago. Menstrual cups and cloth pads. Used the same ones for over a decade and still working great and have saved sooooo much $$ by not buying disposable products. Also never have to worry about ""running out"" and being caught off guards as they are always with me at home (or the collapsible lily cup in my purse). || found plastic free floss in a glass bottle and toothpaste tabs too! locally made so even better. || Less technology use. Between the energy and resources used to make chips and run AI, I‚Äôve seriously cut back on all technology because I‚Äôm simply tired of it. Yes pen and paper may not be ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù but using paper scraps from random junk mail envelopes works just as well for notes, grocery lists, etc. Simplifying my life and zero waste are going hand in hand for me and what I value, because it‚Äôs not just about going zero waste but it‚Äôs about being resourceful and not normalizing how energy intensive technology is nowadays with the abundance of items that are being pushed on us. Also using my old phone until I truly need a new one, my old laptop until I can skate by with purchasing a refurbished one || I‚Äôd be careful, I think capitalism will exploit the green movement to sell more things. Like how people collect so many reusable shopping bags and tumblers. What actually creates less waste is consuming less, not overhauling everything you own with products that market themselves as sustainable. || Instead of the usual plastic soap box for travel, I wrap my bars of body soap, shampoo, and conditioner in little 10x10 cotton hankies. They fit neatly together in a zippered pouch. Naturally, they may get a little wet, but the cloth dries easily. || I make my own moisturizer, out of bulk purchased ingredients. It's just sweet almond oil and Shea butter, with a bit of grape seed oil and vitamin E oil. I control the softness of it, it has no water, no scent additives, etc. It lasts forever and I haven't suffered from my (very bad) eczema since I started making&using it. For me it's miracle stuff and by making my own I save so much money & plastic. Before, while searching for a good salve/cr√®me/moisturiser for body, face, and/or hands, I spent a lot of coin on things that promised to be great but didn't do much, or ended up containing irritants, too much water and/or scent. That resulted in a big stash of unusable product and thus, waste.
Now it's just a few big jars&bottles and a small glass jar that I put the finished stuff in (and that I can reuse). || Doing hobby related meetups in community event spaces.   
  
Saves me from cleaning my house and buying decorations / seating I normally wouldn't. We knit under a shady tree once every other week and even swap stuff we won't use! We also give away magazines and books with hobby info if we don't need them. Everything is set up digitally so no paper fliers. 

I've organized stuff like this in the past and had to buy chairs, plastic covered treats, paper pamphlets and such. Doing it within a community event is so much more eco friendly. There's usually a food vendor if people want snacks. The people who run it provide tables and chairs. It's wonderful! Plus no lightbulbs so it's super energy efficient. || Bringing my own containers with me to a restaurant. I almost always have leftovers, but this way I don't add to the trash mountain of takeout containers. || Idk about a swap, but this has been a fun one for me. I noticed a lot of litter around where I work but I couldn't go grabbing it all with my hands. My first instinct was to get one of those trash grabbers, but they're big and difficult for my wrist and just another product. Ended up getting second hand scissor tongs and they're great! Those bad bois with an old plastic grocery bag and I've got everything I need for a nice luchtime walk. || Bringing eating utensils in your work bag or purse. || Solid shampoo and conditioner (which also double as body wash and shaving cream!). Switched a few years ago and it has saved my hair. I use Kitsch and Earthling, just depends on what‚Äôs on sale. || My reusable napkins and kitchen towels have reduced most of my waste.   When I moved out I was gifted most of my table and silver ware and I really wanted to try and reduce my other consumptions. 

Those silicon bags to replace zip locks are nice too 

Only mistake I made was some of my napkins are a blend with polyester, meaning microplastics. But I did buy all cotton ones as well, so when the polyester ones eventually wear out I can ensure I'm more conscientious || This required me buying something, but a mason jar vacuum sealer has been a game changer now that we are getting a lot of produce from the garden. It keeps veggies just-picked fresh for weeks, which is great for a bumper crop of peas! I‚Äôve used these jars for years, so I didn‚Äôt have to change any habits or storage. 

It prevents so much food waste and money. If I want a cup of buttermilk, I will save the unused portion for next time. Same for so many things. I make most of my own dressings, dips etc and now I can save some. Etc. it‚Äôs fantastic. 

I‚Äôm not shilling here, I‚Äôm saying what I love. || I have some reusable zip lock bags that I like, but they do eventually wear out and stop being airtight. But they're great until that happens! I also love my reusable coffee cup (Joco), stainless steel water bottle (Iron Flask - keeps ice in it all day), and silicone baking mats for cooking (though be aware that they never really feel clean). || I'm slowly building my supply of re-usable produce bags, but cost is a major issue for me. 

I bring my old single-use plastic produce bags to the store and reuse them when I buy new produce. I keep reusing the bags until they fall apart, which seems to be about 10 times.

How do you sustainably run your business?,"Small business ideas, I‚Äôd like to read about how you remain conscious and consistent in your business practice and how you manage your waste (I‚Äôm a ceramicist for context)","I am an escape room owner. We build all our own props for the games and only buy second hand items to repurpose besides electronic components. We‚Äôve even repurposed our own props for other games too. 

For our day to day operations, we do everything electronically where we can, which means no paper records/receipts etc. we also don‚Äôt use trash bags for most of our receptacles since we don‚Äôt collect much trash and it is almost never food, we are able to just dump the trash cans into one trash bag once a week to be taken out. We also use refillable spray bottles for sanitizer and washable rags to clean out games. 
Not only is it more sustainable, it‚Äôs also cheaper in the long run! || I've been running a small custom fragrance design business for about 15 years. Unfortunately, due to the personal (cosmetic) nature of my products, I do have to use a lot of plastic in my packaging for health and safety reasons. That said, here are a few things that I do or don't do-

No packing slips. It never made sense to me to waste a whole sheet of paper to show the customer what they already have on their email receipt. Same goes for *non-business related freebies/inserts*. Sending extras like candy or pens or whatever just increases your packaging weight, costs, consumer waste, and in the long run uses more fuel to ship. I don't even ship business cards, though that's something I've considered doing when I reopen soon, and that's at least business related. Stick a coupon on it for repeat business. My 'cards' are actually stickers of my logo, so at least there's a chance of it being used rather than tossed immediately, so try to get creative in that regard. 

Paper stuffing. I do need to use bubble wrap for individual glass bottles, as well as sealable plastic bags for alcohol based perfumes (as per shipping regulations), but any other package stuffing is honeycomb paper. If you'd rather use something like packing peanuts, get the cornstarch ones, but be sure you have a REALLY DRY place for storage. I live in the Pacific Northwest, so those aren't really a feasible option for me to use.

You could easily reuse packing materials that you receive from your own purchases, just be sure to remove/cover any original labeling. If you print your own shipping labels, depending on your printer, you can get 100% recycled labels.

Ship USPS whenever you can. I'm a USPS stan. You can schedule a free package pickup 6 days a week, and they will collect your outgoing orders on their regular daily route, which means you're not wasting fuel to go to the post office. This does require the aforementioned bit of printing your own labels. They will also provide free boxes for priority shipping (again, they'll deliver these for free so you don't have to go to the post office), and I believe those are at least partially made from post-consumer materials. Also I believe Ground Advantage is the most fuel efficient service, and typically comes with $100 insurance included. || I own an online ZW shop. There's A LOT that can be done to keep businesses zero waste. A few of my faves:

\-- Reused shipping materials. I collect boxes and packing materials from friends, family, customers, neighbors, and my local Buy Nothing Group. In the 6 1/2 years we've been in business, I haven't purchased any packing materials, and only a handful of 100% PCR boxes.

\-- As u/EatMeBoutique mentioned, shipping via USPS. They're coming to your home and your customers' homes every day (assuming you're in the US), and you can schedule free pickups so you don't even have to drive to the post office. By shipping through USPS, I've learned that shipping my heaviest product across the country actually emits less CO2 than me driving to the grocery store 4 miles down the street.

\-- Provide free return labels for empty containers to come back for washing and refilling. I'm a big believer that the customer should never be responsible for packaging, so we provide free return labels for our customers to return their empties to us so we can keep them in circulation.

\-- Refurbished and secondhand furniture. Nearly all of my office supplies, including my label printer, desk, and shelving unites, are secondhand. FB Marketplace and Offer Up are incredible for this!

All-in-all, what I've found most important is communicating everything with your customer. We're proud to use ""ugly boxes,"" and love to talk about why we only ship through the postal service and where we get all of our supplies, equipment, inventory, etc. Especially when it comes to packaging (since shipping ceramics requires quite a lot of padding), as long as you're proud of your ""ugly packaging"" and confident in your ""why,"" your people will love you for it.",13,ZeroWaste,2025-07-07 21:18:44,sustainably run business,small business ideas like read remain conscious consistent business practice manage waste ceramicist context,escape room owner build props games buy second hand items repurpose besides electronic components even repurposed props games day day operations everything electronically means paper records receipts etc also use trash bags receptacles since collect much trash almost never food able dump trash cans one trash bag week taken also use refillable spray bottles sanitizer washable rags clean games sustainable also cheaper long run running small custom fragrance design business years unfortunately due personal cosmetic nature products use lot plastic packaging health safety reasons said things packing slips never made sense waste whole sheet paper show customer already email receipt goes non business related freebies inserts sending extras like candy pens whatever increases packaging weight costs consumer waste long run uses fuel ship even ship business cards though something considered reopen soon least business related stick coupon repeat business cards actually stickers logo least chance used rather tossed immediately try get creative regard paper stuffing need use bubble wrap individual glass bottles well sealable plastic bags alcohol based perfumes per shipping regulations package stuffing honeycomb paper rather use something like packing peanuts get cornstarch ones sure really dry place storage live pacific northwest really feasible option use could easily reuse packing materials receive purchases sure remove cover original labeling print shipping labels depending printer get recycled labels ship usps whenever usps stan schedule free package pickup days week collect outgoing orders regular daily route means wasting fuel go post office require aforementioned bit printing labels also provide free boxes priority shipping deliver free go post office believe least partially made post consumer materials also believe ground advantage fuel efficient service typically comes insurance included online zw shop lot done keep businesses zero waste faves reused shipping materials collect boxes packing materials friends family customers neighbors local buy nothing group years business purchased packing materials handful pcr boxes u eatmeboutique mentioned shipping via usps coming home customers homes every day assuming us schedule free pickups even drive post office shipping usps learned shipping heaviest product across country actually emits less co driving grocery store miles street provide free return labels empty containers come back washing refilling big believer customer never responsible packaging provide free return labels customers return empties us keep circulation refurbished secondhand furniture nearly office supplies including label printer desk shelving unites secondhand fb marketplace offer incredible found important communicating everything customer proud use ugly boxes love talk ship postal service get supplies equipment inventory etc especially comes packaging since shipping ceramics requires quite lot padding long proud ugly packaging confident people love
What does recycling look like in places where bins are rare ?,"What does recycling look like in places where bins are rare?

I‚Äôve been living in remote Central Australia and started picking up 10c bottles and cans to reduce waste.

There‚Äôs no formal collection here it‚Äôs just red dirt, heat and long walks to gather containers. I‚Äôve been doing this solo now and it‚Äôs made me wonder‚Ä¶

What does sustainable recycling look like when infrastructure is lacking?

Would love to hear what others have seen or done where recycling isn‚Äôt accessible. 
 
REPOST ","My parents live rural in NZ and a few years ago the council finally organised for their area to get rubbish and recycling bins. Previously they'd have rubbish collection weekly in large sturdy council branded paper bags. However, recycling wasn't an option so they'd keep it all in large old plastic bins or boxes in the garage and then take it to the recycling centre next to the dump in town every week or so (they have a business so it could accumulate quickly). Many a Saturday morning before sports was spent sorting recycling at the recycling centre while trying not to breathe deeply because it smelt so bad. Most people in the area didn't recycle at all until recently though. || I think the whole name of the game is putting pressure on government to create infrastructure.

Recommendations for Eco-Friendly Lawn & Garden Services in Florida?,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm currently based in Florida and looking to shift my yard care toward more sustainable, low-waste practices. I know traditional lawn maintenance often involves a lot of water, fuel, and synthetic chemicals, so I‚Äôd love to find a local lawn care or gardening service that understands and supports zero-waste or eco-conscious methods.

I‚Äôm especially looking for services that prioritize:

* Manual or electric mowing (instead of gas-powered)
* Composting or mulching grass clippings and organic waste
* Avoidance of synthetic fertilizers or pesticides
* Support for native plant landscaping or edible gardening
* Low-water landscaping or xeriscaping practices

If you‚Äôve worked with a company or individual who ‚Äúgets it‚Äù and really respects the zero-waste mindset, please let me know! I‚Äôm not trying to promote any business, just hoping to make informed, responsible choices and support local professionals doing good work.

Thanks in advance!","Hey! I switched to eco-friendly lawn care last year and found someone through GreenPal who used manual mowing and mulched clippings.

How do you balance zero waste with minimalism?,"I‚Äôve been living an increasingly zero-waste lifestyle for about 9 years now. After a few moves, I‚Äôve downsized a lot and kept mostly stuff I actually use. Even then, I still feel like I own too much and it barely fits in our apartment. I‚Äôm definitely not an extreme minimalist, but I do like having less clutter and fewer things to clean/store/move etc.

Now my FIL is moving and getting rid of a ton of stuff. The thing is, I know that a lot of donated items still end up in landfills‚Äîeither here or shipped off to other countries where they can mess with the environment and people‚Äôs health. So I'm really reluctant to donate bags and bags of stuff, but I don't want to bin them either.

So I've been bringing a bunch of it home. It‚Äôs all good quality, and I‚Äôd much rather use secondhand stuff than buy new. But then again these are all nice to have items rather than necessary ones. So now my garage is suddenly very full :(

Has anyone else gone through this? How did you manage it?","I try to give things away within my community before taking it to a charity shop. Buy Nothing is great - there is almost always someone interested, even for the most random stuff. I also work with a lot of younger people who are usually happy to take free furniture and housewares. Clothing is really the only category I worry about ending up in the international waste stream - it‚Äôs worth putting in effort to sort out what is likely to be used locally vs. what has little value. Business wear can go to charities helping people find jobs. A lot of casual wear can go to consignment and vintage shops. Other things can be upcycled or recycled. || Hoarding things you don‚Äôt need to save them from the landfill is still hoarding. It‚Äôs just stuff. Stuff you did not create or purchase and are not responsible for. Getting in the business of rescuing other people‚Äôs stuff is risky.¬† || Minimalism is not my goal, but I need to not hoard.

One system that works for me is assigning spaces. E.g. I will only save as many food containers as I can fit in one box. If my designate shelf space is full of glass jars, I need to put the rest into recycling. Maybe I can put a new jar on the shelf if it‚Äôs a size I want, but I need to get rid of another one.

You could put some shelves into your garage, fill them reasonably and anything extra can‚Äôt be stored in your home. And don‚Äôt start renting an extra storage space for extras.

I got many things for my student apartment because my grandma moved to a new house, maybe you can find a person starting a new household and ‚Äúadopt‚Äù them. A buy nothing group is of course a good idea.

Another idea is to offer them to friends. Have a box of things you want to give away, put near your entrance and show it to them when you are having a gathering. Or show it to a person coming to pick up something you posted in the buy nothing group.

Personally, I even buy used stuff online (via Ebay e.g.) So selling things is an option as well, although it needs effort. Having a yard sale is another idea. Maybe you can synchronize with your neighbours and have a whole neighbourhood yard sale. That could attract more people. || Facebook Marketplace is how I usually get rid of things. You can give things away for free or charge for them and someone will generally take it if you wait long enough.

That said, a common trap of minimalism is to buy stuff, throw it away, then buy more stuff. It can be very consumerist in that way. || There's a lot of people practicing high consumption, minimalist lifestyles.  They just acquire stuff, then throw it away when they are done with it, in order to create space for more stuff.  They find the process cathartic.

Garbage isn't a defined thing, but a product people make.  A thing becomes garbage when our relationship to it changes.

The obverse is the low consumption hoarder.  This is a person who becomes a target for the high consumption person, as an enabler.  They are uninterested in stuff, but don't believe in waste, and wind up with donations from the high consumption friend or family member.  They end up keeping and wearing these hated items for a decade or two.  Their ever-renewing loathing of non-biodegradable and inappropriately purposed textiles manifests as a vendetta.

This is how you wind up needing a license and training to purchase things. || If it‚Äôs good quality thrift stores wont throw it out or ship it to another country. Thrift stores are overwhelmed with broken and low quality items that the original owners don‚Äôt want to admit is trash. 

Find independent thrift stores because they will tell you if they don‚Äôt have space. 

Women‚Äôs shelters often take donations to help women furnish new apartments. They actually really need bikes as many women fleeing DV don‚Äôt have transportation!

Church‚Äôs often take donations for yard sales and use profits for various programs and community projects. 

You can sell clothes by the bag on fb marketplace. Take pictures of shirts put them in a trash bag ‚Äú20 for all not for sale individually‚Äù style you make less but get rid of more. 

Post on your local facebook groups and tell them you have a bunch of stuff from your FIL you can‚Äôt use and ask if there are any nonprofits that could use them to get more specific organizations! || I've given away loads of things on Facebook buy nothing groups. But yea, there's things no one wants. So I have taken some to a donation box and some things I have just thrown away or recycled if possible. It's not like this thing is going to be useful just sitting in my home. A clear space and a clear mind is important too. And always remember the first rule of minimalism is not bringing these things into your home in the first place and saying no to things you don't need. || Give it away on FB marketplace, your local buy nothing group, or on the curb.

Your opinion on refill packs?,"Hi guys . I want to slowly start being more low waste not quite Zero waste,so I was wondering if refills like the picture above is better than getting a new bottle everytime ","While its still plastic, its less plastic than buying a new bottle every time. 

I do this with dishsoap - I buy a gallon jug and refill a small bottle. 

Overall, it's still a reduction in your plastic consumption. Is it as good as find a plastic free alternative? No, but its the next best step and still a viable strategy (and sometimes there aren't plastic-free alternatives). || It's my opinion that they should be way fucking bigger. Like giant. 

Ideally there would be a dispenser next to the items on the shelf. 

I would hope for a way to make shops do it would be to make the refiller fit in a standard shelf and have it be occasionally topped up by staff using a large container kept in the stock area. 

If I want to buy a years supply of shampoo I should be able to do so in a minimal number of plastic containers. || Much like everyone else has said, these are not recyclable. Yes it's less plastic than buying a new bottle, but honestly hard soap bars or powder soap would be a better option. 

Additionally, la roche posey is owned by Loreal which Nestle has a 23% stake in, Nestl√© is an awful company and if you would prefer to continue to buy refill packs, I'd personally advise to buy a different brand. || I don‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre made out of plastic when making refills out of aluminium, glass, and cartons is just as accessible. Overall, you‚Äôre using less plastic which is a good thing, but it rubs me the wrong way they‚Äôre acknowledging that plastic is bad, but not using a material like aluminium instead, which is like pennies more per container || I use them when available. Lesser evil || Marginally. What also matters is the product‚Äôs impact on the environment¬† || Unfortunately, that kind of plastic is less recyclable than a hard plastic bottle. I avoid anything that comes in a soft plastic envelope or bag. It's going straight into the landfill, or getting burned (ugh), or ending up in the ocean. 

Refills are a good idea, but look for refills that come in a carton or a hard bottle. || I hate this type of refill pack. Like, that is going in the landfill 100%. And I hate the flimsy plastic. I love the concept but wish it used some other type of material. || My dream is for Target or other big stores to set up a huge refill station for branded shampoos, dish soap, hand soap, etc.... I know it'll never happen bc customers suck but it's still a dream üí≠ || We have started doorstep refilling in Bengaluru of cleaning supplies. You use the existing bottles you have at home to store the liquids we provide. 
So Zero plastic generated. 

No refill packs at all. Even these are plastic and can't be reused or recycled. || I kinda hate them, but sometimes if they're the only thing I can find (especially for shampoo and conditioner), I do buy them. I know they're going in the trash but so is a plastic bottle and that's more plastic. || Pouches like that can also be preferable because they can sometimes be shipped more efficiently than other types of packaging. Less wasted volume in the shipping container reduces waste by making the shipping process more efficient. || The plastic that these come in is a lot less recyclable than the bottle. || - Green washing
- a way for them to save on costs but sell you the same (I even found some of those being sold for more than the bottles) 

And also I question the recyclability of this type of plastics .... || Yes there can be a lot of improvements here but I appreciate the baby steps in the right direction, plus I save money and find it easier to empty these out compared to the standard bottles || Buying refill packs is a better choice if you want to generate less plastic waste, remember we have a plastic pollution problem. These pouches are usually not recyclable in the US. In some countries, you can buy refill packs or pouches of everything (bleach, soap, shampoo, laundry detergent, catchup, mustard, etc.) and they are much cheaper than buying the plastic bottle, but for some reason in the US options are very limited and often the consumer product company wants to charge you more for the refill than for the heavier plastic bottle. || I really wish stores would get multi gallon containers and you could fill up your personal sized bottles with. 

Like refill sizes are a step in the right direction but I wish it could go to the next logical step. || I think the big gallon sized ones are pretty good for things like dish soap, lately I‚Äôve been seeing refills for hand soap that are like 2-3 refills and that seems a little silly || This is not related to the refill pack, but I bought this specific refill of face wash and it turns out they changed the formula and my face broke out like crazy.

Stainless Steel Litter Boxes and Non Stick Coatings,"Is there anyway to avoid coatings sprayed onto stainless steel litter pans? Does anyone have a link to a good one (at least 20 inches in length as I have a Fantastic Fluff)? 

iPrimio sells one openly advertised as finished with Teflon (which leaches PFAS). I bought one off Amazon from a different brand (claiming only to be steel), and after the first litter change (every two weeks), the steel had a sticky, crumbly residue of a clear coat. I ended up recycling it because I was worried what my cats were scratching and accidentally ingesting. So it ended up not being sustainable. 

  
Or is plastic the only way to go to avoid this chemical exposure? Sigh. ","PFAS is not going to leach into your litter and harm your cats.  Touching non stick does nothing. Even non stick cooking pans that aren‚Äôt damaged won‚Äôt do this.  Finished teflon is inert. The real problem with non stick is the chemicals of production end up leaching into the water supply. || Most of those coatings can be removed with acetone. Mind you, acetone itself is nasty stuff and you'd need to wear a vapor mask and/or do the work outdoors. It evaporates very fast, so at least you don't have to worry about pouring it down a drain.

But without the coating, cat pee is going to degrade the steel, won't it? 

I also avoid plastic products but I think it's reasonable to make a distinction between single-use and long-use objects. Yes, still better to buy products that are biodegradable or that degrade without offgassing and microparticulates. But I've had the same plastic litter box for probably 20 years and it's still working fine.

Really struggling with zero waste as an autistic person,"Hi, I have autism, and I'm struggling really badly with zero waste. A lot of my safe foods (indomie noodles, pizzas, chips, crisps, etc) come packaged in plastic. I'm not sure how to cut down on my plastic waste when most of my safe foods/supplies are packaged in plastic :/

Any tips?","Fellow autistic:


Fed is best.


Buying in large bags and bulk can help cut down the waste, and so does giving each bag a second life -- use them for small trash bags, poop bags, etc.¬†


But ultimately it's okay to have some waste if that's what you need to survive. Awareness and conscious choice means a lot too - you got this. <3 || It's OK. Just be mindful of other stuff. It doesn't have to be perfect. || Surviving is more important than zero waste. Everyone has some things that they cant give up, or won‚Äôt give up for a while. Just do your best in other areas and focus on what you CAN do || Hey, please don‚Äôt feel guilty for eating your safe foods. Being completely plastic-free is honestly a luxury most people can‚Äôt afford, especially when you‚Äôre dealing with specific needs like autism or medical issues. Everyone has something that leads to plastic use, whether it‚Äôs food packaging, medications, or medical supplies.

Your wellbeing matters more than a perfect zero-waste lifestyle. You‚Äôre already doing your best just by being aware and caring.. and that‚Äôs more than a lot of people. Small changes can help over time, but your health and comfort come first, always. || Perfection is the enemy of good. Or something. 
Don't beat yourself up trying to be perfect do the best you can that day. If the next day can be better, fine. If not, fine. 
Your chip bag isn't important in the grand scheme of things. || The problem with plastics is both individual and systemic. You reduce what you can without harming yourself or others (think medical/sterilized things) and you, as you are able, advocate for alternatives. 

- Contact companies and ask what they are doing to reduce their use

- support research on alternative methods of packaging

- advocate to your representatives for changes to the oil and fishing industries

And you don't have to be perfect. You trying your best and balancing your needs/preferences is doing more than Bezos ever could. I'm not xtian but Luke 21:1-4 is correct. || ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do all the good the world needs, but the world needs all the good you can do‚Äù

There are other things that don‚Äôt relate to your safe foods that you might be able to do instead. || Perfection is the enemy of good.   Just be good, when you can. You got this! || It became easier for me when I started doing what I could and giving myself a break for everything else. I can‚Äôt not use a straw for iced drinks because of my sensory issues, but that‚Äôs ok because I get my rice and beans in bulk. We do what we can || We don‚Äôt need everyone doing zero-waste perfectly. We need many people doing their best. Your own health can‚Äôt be put at risk when it comes to this. Because if so, you‚Äôre not going to be left with the strength to continue at all. 

Just be mindful and do your best where you can üíû || We need a lot of people doing zero waste imperfectly, not a few people doing it perfectly. Do what you can within your ability. If food is difficult, focus on another area.¬† || Just do what you can it doesn't have to be perfect. If everyone did a little it would have more impact than say 100 people doing it perfectly.

If you can sustainably change a few things that's so much better than trying to go 100% and making yourself miserable and stressed out. || Zero waste is not possible. Just be mindfull about it and sort it well for recycling.

I've got an autistic friend who feels really guilty for his plastic waste. Now every saterday he's cleaning a busy intersection and a bikeroad in the forest. He gets bags from the city also because he's doing such a good job. Can't handle people praising him while he's working so i helped him find some quiet bikeroads and drive him there. Doesn't want me with him so i just sit in the car and wait till we can drive to the container park/recycling point and dump the trash.

Maybe you can do something similar if it's doable in your area.

//Edit: i gave him special gloves (glass, needles resistant), a picker so he doesn't need to bend and i made a holder for 3 bags he can carry/roll with him. Paper, plastic, aluminium cans. || Give yourself some grace. No one is perfect. You can always search out more sustainable brands of packaged foods or brands that come in recyclable/reusable/compostable packaging. The more local your food chain is, the more sustainable it is. Learning to make your own foods from scratch can help too.

If you're interested in that, you can make noodles, pizza dough, and crackers from sourdough starter. Deli items like pepperoni and mozzarella can be bought in bulk from the counter (probably came in plastic, but bulk packaging minmizes) and slice/shred it at home. My local grocery deli will slice and weigh out my items and then put them in my metal or silicone containers for checkout. || Nobody is 100%! It‚Äôs not realistic and a very privileged thing to be able to do. Do what you can. || Consider looking at bulk purchases of the products you love. Look at restaurant supply places, online, or direct with the local distributor.

You could also do some research on purchasing bulk plain ramen noodles and seasoning them yourself! Either seeing if you can re-create the noodle seasoning packet yourself or creating a new flavor that you enjoy. It could be a fun project. 

Chips/crisps are a bit harder to do at home, so perhaps not DIY-able. 

Certainly pizzas can be done really well at home if you are able to invest in a pizza oven. There are some incredible dough recipes out there (I'm a particular fan of slow, fermented types. The flavor is incredible *chef's kiss*)

Completely understand if the cooking/prep aspect of these suggests are out of reach! It can be expensive to change habits and find substitutes. But if you are interested in cooking craft, it can be a fun hobby to slowly explore. I would choose one thing I want to get good at (the pizza dough, for example) and try 1 new recipe every other week or so and adjust until it was EXACTLY right for my mouth. There has to be joy in the improvement process though, seeing triumph in the slow march towards perfection, so I wouldn't recommend if that's not something you enjoy (meaning having to taste some failures!).

Some other non-cooking things:

1. Try to do soft plastic recycling where you can. Oftentimes you have to take it somewhere, but the infrastructure and processes are improving

2. Check if there are any 'safe' foods that are packaged more sustainably. For example, we have some regular frozen foods now that are just packaged in cardboard box, rather than plastic wrap as well. 

3. Reach out to the companies who make the safe foods and ask about their sustainability practices. Perhaps do this once every 6 months. It will keep reminding them that people care about this.

4. Look into creative ways to reuse the soft plastics. Plastic yarn, making coasters, packing material....that sort of thing.

And like everyone else has said, no one is 100%. Think about other parts of your life where you can be more sustainable: riding/walking/public transport instead of driving, eating less meat, buy electricity from a company that uses renewable production, buy second hand items rather than new, reduce overall consumption of things and buy durable, long lasting items when replacing your things.

Welcome to the team! || Have  you considered making your own frozen pizza? They are pretty simple to make and freeze once you get the hang of it and it will be less expensive and less waste? it‚Äôs probably not a good substitute for the indomie noodles, but my city actually has a small noodle manufacturing facility (it is really just a small storefront in a historic grocery in the old japantown area) where you can go and purchase fresh or dried noodles. It‚Äôs a fun novelty, but not as convenient as instant noodles and may not fit that niche for you. || Film plastics are among the most recyclable, but the processing is involved.¬†


So, not with your regular garbage.¬† However there is often a place or bin at a grocery store or something like a Target for clean film plastic recycling.¬†¬†


Hope this helps. || I can relate to this. I have multiple dietary restrictions due to chronic health issues, and I'm also particular about ingredients in general. So my options are limited as it is. While some brands are already focused on eco-friendly packaging, some are not. We finally got lucky with our local recycling center accepting almost all types of plastic, so at least I'm throwing away less than before. || I‚Äôd give yourself a break on this one.

Biodegradable House Supplies and Clothes,"I've been looking for a company that provides undyed natural fabrics either grown or made in the USA. Whenever I found a company or item, there was always *something* about the fabric that was damaging to the environment \[i.e., packaging, dyes, presence of elastic fibers, etc.\] The struggle to find consistently natural fabric items was real. 

Then I stumbled onto [Rawganique](https://rawganique.com/). They sell clothing, bathroom, bedroom, and kitchen cloth supplies that are 100% undyed, organic, and grown/woven in responsible factories in the USA, Canada, or Europe. It's a one-stop shop for all your basics and I love it. It saves so much headache - and the prices aren't bad at all. 

I don't have any affiliation with this company and haven't tried their products. But I'm so so glad I found them and wanted to immediately let this community know about it since the struggle is real. 

I know that the most eco-friendly fabric would be from a thrift store. But oftentimes I can't find essential items \[ie. underwear, socks, bedsheets, etc.\] and if I do find something non-essential it's made from plastic or harsh chemicals. For anyone who wants something without plastics, hypoallergenic, and/or wants to support a minimal-waste business check rawganique out :D ","I've learned to make some of those hard to find essentials, using cotton tshirts that are fairly abundant in thrift stores. I should post some of my patterns. || Wow, this company is great! Thanks so much for sharing! I feel so blessed to have randomly stumbled upon this post. You know, I have recently been looking for organic, all natural socks. I finally found a place that sells them thanks to another redditor, a company called Q for Quinn. But from that journey I learned how hard it is to find socks with no elastane in them. Or most clothing for that matter, but socks especially. 

This company, Rawganique, looks like the majority of things they sell is 100% natural fibre. And another great thing is that everything is made in North America or Europe, which is super rare for clothing. I'll be checking them out some more and plan on buying from them soon.

Must haves for new apartment,"I‚Äôm moving soon and would like most things zero waste. What would you recommend? Also, in having trouble with what to do about a hamper and lotion. My hamper is broken and I want to buy a new one, but I don‚Äôt want it to break again or get ripped, what do you recommend? Also, I whats is an eco friendly lotion? I‚Äôd prefer if I could refill instead of buy plastic bottles with lotion inside everytime. Thnx ","Is the hamper repairable, even if it might not look great? I‚Äôve been using a hamper with a broken handle for 20+ years, just ‚Äúfix‚Äù it with fresh duct tape occasionally. 

For lotion, look at lotion bars. They‚Äôre a solid form usually with some beeswax and other ingredients. || Have you looked for a second hand hamper I see them pop up online occasionally || I switched to solid consumables for the most part, solid shampoo bars, solid lotion bars, solid body soap, and laundry sheets.

Can‚Äôt relate to the hamper, I use a trash bin - but could you throw it in a backpack/bag if you need to transport it? The pillow case suggestions a pod idea. || Get dish towels for the kitchen and a stack of shop cloths for all other cleaning.

A stack of big hankies instead of facial tissue, and cloth napkins for paper napkins.

For toilet paper, attach a bidet and get a packet of flannel baby wipes.

If you're dealing with menstruation or incontinence, get absorbent panties and washable pads.

Now you won't have to buy paper products for years! || Get a cloth bag for a hamper. You can sew one out of thrifted sheets really easily, find a big potato or rice bag, or get an ikea shopping bag because they last forever and they're easier to carry than hampers || If you want specifics: I currently have a few brands I use that I think are at least more zero waste than mainstream. I recommend Ethique bars for shampoo, conditioner, face wash, and body wash over any other brands I have tried. I have curly hair and sensitive skin, and they are the only bars that have not left me itching uncontrollably later in the day. Drops is a brand I have liked for laundry and dishes. Also, ""if you care"" dishwasher pods have worked pretty well to clean dishes. If you want a bar of dish soap, zero waste mvmt solid dish soap bar works well for me and Clearalif laundry strips smell good and have worked as well, but it looks like they are only sold on Amazon and I don't know if there are companies you want to stay away from. The toilet cleaner strips I have used are off Amazon as well and I know their eco footprint is not something to be proud of. I am fairly new to trying to be more sustainable, so if any of these brands are a no go, someone please enlighten me. I think bamboo and wheat straw are also good options for things like toothebrushes, flossers, dish brushes, bathroom cleaning, etc. My mother in law likes to use vinegar cleaning solutions on everything, and I will say, her house is quite sparkling. I don't know the science behind disinfecting properties though. Reusable cloth paper towels are also great, but you do need to wash them rather than just clean up and toss. And expect stains. It is also unfortunate, but where I live, expect these more eco friendly and zero waste options to be hard to find and expensive as all get out most of the time. But at least it feels a lot better when using them. || Is your laundry in unit? If so, just throw your clothes in the washer. And sort them on laundry day. || Look around your area and see if there's a store that sells bulk cleaning liquids and soaps. The kind where you can bring your own container to fill up. Check places that sell bulk spices, health foods, etc. || Plaine beauty does a refillable aluminum container for their lotion, I havent tried it but plan to once I run out of my old stuff. For hampers it kinda depends on what you use it for, like are you taking clothes to the laundromat or just using it within your own house? Either way you might have luck second hand, (and dont have to feel as bad if it eventually breaks) but especiallly if you are using it in your house because then you can find a solid one (if you are transporting clothes with it a fabric bag is probably better) || I use a market basket as a laundry hamper. They‚Äôre made out of natural fibers, good quality, hand made and repairable! Highly recommend. I think I found it second hand for $5 about 15 years ago. 

Also chiming in about lotion bars. They‚Äôre the best! || I would say an instant pot. It allows you to avoid a lot of packaged and canned foods. If you have a place that sells bulk dried beans, rice, quinoa etc, you can cook them super fast in an instant pot. I soak my beans overnight in the fridge, but you don‚Äôt have to. They key is to not add salt during cooking - don‚Äôt understand the chemistry, but it interrupts the beans ability to absorb water. Salt and seasonings totally okay to add to grains while cooking though. || For the hamper, they sell sturdy fabric ones that seem hard to break.

For zero waste products, invest in some stasher/silicone Ziploc bags. They can be pricey but I love them. Make sure to buy the ones that are dishwasher, freezer and microwave safe so you can use them for anything || For a laundry hamper, I use a basket made of plant materials. I've had it for years and it's great. Before that, I used a thrifted pillow case. 

For lotion, bag balm.

Use a silicone spatula to scrape it off, that‚Äôll get almost all out. Then itll be safe to wash as normal || Once you've poured extra oil into a container and are ready to wash the pan, drizzle some dish soap in the pan but \*NOT\* water. Mix the oil and soap up in the pan with a dishcloth, brush, or your hand. The oil will turn a milky white color but not develop a much of a lather. Once you've mixed it up, slowly add water and continue to mix.  It will start to look more like a soapy mix and rinse cleanly from the pan.

How to reduce waste from food products (not food waste),"Hi all,

recently i‚Äôve been thinking about how much waste i produce from simply just eating. Empty blueberry containers, peanut butter jars, etc.

I try to buy glass vs plastic when the option is available, but can‚Äôt help feeling like there‚Äôs a better way.

Any practical tips?

EDIT: thank u guys all so much for the tips. I think the next step for me is buying in bulk more at places where u can refill. Whole Foods might be my only option for this where I live. Luckily I love the planet more than I hate Amazon lol","Buy as much in bulk as you can. Also see if there are any refill stores near you (where you bring your own container and they tare your weight so you can use them to fill up on your groceries and essentials). || I buy from the farmer's market, the refill store and other food shops where they serve me in my own containers.

If I can't find it package free, I tro to make it myself (for exemple, I make mascarpone and the fluffy biscuits¬† for a tiramisu.) Or¬†I try to find solutions where they will take back their glass bottles or jars. || Reduce, reuse, recycle is in that order for a reason. First step is reduce what you can, of course which you are doing by trying to pick glass/reusable options first. 

You‚Äôre doing good on the first step, so next is reuse. How many of the items you‚Äôre throwing away can you actually reuse? Peanut butter jars are pretty sturdy, and lighter than glass so they‚Äôre good for storing things you‚Äôll take on the go. They‚Äôre also great for storing small things like buttons or nails or loose batteries. Some types of plastic (like the kind often used in produce containers) can be reused as crafts like shrinky dinks so you might be able to make Christmas ornaments or something with them. Maybe look at what you have an excess of and check Pinterest for reuse/repurposing ideas. Or see if you have a local craft group that would be interested in some of the products you would otherwise toss. Some art people use those bread tabs as mosaic tiles for art pieces, things like that, so you might be able to donate them. Community centers also may take some items as well for the sake of cheap crafts, but it really does depend a lot on the types id programs your local center has. And if you even have anything local. You can also check local buy nothing groups or freecycle groups. I know that egg cartons are one thing people can‚Äôt seem to get enough of. 

Last, if there are items you can‚Äôt reuse, can‚Äôt donate, can‚Äôt get out of purchasing, that‚Äôs when you turn to recycling. Maybe get a dedicated kitchen plastics recycling system going? You might need to spend a little money to join a service if you dont already have a recycling program where you live or if that program doesn‚Äôt service plastics only paper products. Can‚Äôt hurt to look into options? Finding a good recycling program isn‚Äôt always easy though so good luck. || I largely buy my blueberries frozen from Costco in a 3 or 4lb bag. It's much less plastic than I was going through buying them fresh (I really like blueberries, lol).

I'm shifting my other produce to buying from local growers, which has no packaging. It's hard because of when and where those opportunities are vs the convenience of a grocery store. || I feel this a lot, OP.

use the galss jars as containers for yor household or donate (no buy group, freecycle, geev...) to people who might reuse them for jam, canning or just as is.

brying dry legumes or fresh insted of canned ... stuff like that? || I got reusable produce bags that I take with me to the store.  If you have a local food co-op or health food store, they often have more bulk options than typical grocery stores do, although it can also be more expensive.

Buy as much not pre-packed. Loose veggies and fruits. Meat over the counter wrapped in paper instead of a (too huge) plastic box. I use linnen sacks for these and when i need to add a weight sticker on them i just put them on that bag and comes off quite easily.

Buy large cans of oil instead of a small bottle at a time. Same for vinegar.

Salt and pepper in bigbag and put them in small useable container.

I sent some worn out socks and underwear to Girlfriend Collection and got a big coupon for doing so (yay) and thought about sending my outstretched bathing suits too, but their site doesn't specifically say they'll take swimsuits, and it doesn't seem to be a category they sell (yet). Should I send them some bathing suits? Or is there somewhere better to take them? Girlfriend Co uses Supercircle to recycle and I was trying to find a list of other brands that use that service for consumer recycling to find a place which takes swimwear, but there doesn't seem to be a conclusive list of Supercircle clients that I can find. Any ideas? I'm tired of old swimwear taking up space in my bureau, haha.

","J Crew has partnered with Super Circle to do bathing suit recycling! https://jcrew.supercircle.world/landing/ || Back when I worked there H&M would take old textiles for recycling (anything - not just their brand‚Äôs clothes) and give a 30% off coupon to those who donated.

Clinical Strength Deodorant?,"I really want to switch to a more sustainable deodorant, but I currently can only use clinical strength deodorant. 
I get sweaty easily and I am very particular about how I smell, especially since I work closely with others. 
Does anyone have any recommendations for deodorant that is sustainable and works as well as clinical strength? ","It‚Äôs insane to me that there is no deodorant with aluminium in refillable or non-plastic packaging anywhere. You can find a ton of options without aluminium at any Target, Whole Foods, or Natural Grocers, but you want Old Spice in paper? Can‚Äôt help you there || What's the reason you don't see your current deo as sustainable and how would a more sustainable deo look like? || I use Helmm which is refillable although still comes in some plastic. I have hyperhydrosis so I definitely won't be giving up aluminum any time soon and they were the only refillable antiperspirant I could find || We use hypochlorous acid (generate at home, basic ingredients) and potassium alum (minimal packaging, alum block lasts months) for deodorant, paired works for up to 24-48 hours of no odor. Aluminum chloride for antiperspirant. || As someone with an active job, I sadly given up all hope that a low waste option could ever be up to the task and just use what works. I try to be zero waste in other ways, but you can‚Äôt win them all, especially in the health hygiene department. Actual reasearch and efficiency beats feel good vibes. || I too am looking for this. Postpartum hormones have hit me like a truck. Clinical strength is the only thing controlling the sweat and smell. || Absolut Torr - antiperspirant that last for 7 days. You put it on at night, then wash it off the next morning. It works for at least a week even if you shower twice a day. Glass bottle for dabbing liquid. Super cost effective also!

https://absoluttorr.se/en/home/ || Try Glycolic Acid. The stink is not from the sweat itself but from bacteria. The acid will allow your body to regulate itself and sweat naturally and just kills the BO causing bacteria. I use it as a spray, often without any deodorant. || Attitude Orange Leaves works for 24 hours or more (and that's in the summer without a daily shower and peri-menopausal sweat) || Idk how it compares to clinical strength, but probiotic deodorant kills the smell-causing bacteria and is the only thing that works for my gym-obsessed spouse. Maybe worth looking into?¬† || I used clinical deodorant for about 7-8 years. I switched in the winter to Little Seed - only sustainable deodorant that has worked for me. I just did a detox beforehand and a detox now about once a month.

[https://littleseedfarm.com/collections/deodorant](https://littleseedfarm.com/collections/deodorant) || For slightly different reasons I was recently looking for something similar. I‚Äôve landed on using Duradry gel at night a couple times a week, with a different deodorant-only product in the morning to deal with any odor. It comes in a small plastic tube, so it‚Äôs not perfect, but it works well and the amount of plastic is far less than the clinical deodorants I used to use. 

I saw someone else in this thread mention Absolute Torr which is a similar product. Depending on where you live it may be easier to get one or the other. || Have you tried regular deodorant? While it doesn‚Äôt block the sweat, in my experience it still does a great job of blocking the smell, or covering it. || There is a difference between deodorant and antiperspirant. Sounds like you want the latter. || Sweat doesn‚Äôt equal stink.  It‚Äôs the sweat plus skin bacteria that make us funky.  Bacteria use the compounds in sweat and the by products they make smell.

That‚Äôs why you‚Äôll see anti-perspirant and anti-odor on regular DO containers.

Aluminum works by plugging your sweat glands. 

Other ingredients work by creating an inhospitable area for bacteria on your skin.

Natural DOs typically skip the aluminum and focus on making an environment where there aren‚Äôt bacteria. 

I‚Äôd argue a lot of clinical vs regular DO is just marketing. For Secret, the regular invisible solid is 19% aluminum (‚Ä¶) versus 20% if you pay a 50%+ markup.

I say this not to discount the fact that some work for a body and some don‚Äôt.

I really just wanted to share a bit more info I‚Äôve learned over the years.  I‚Äôve found one I‚Äôm happy with but doesn‚Äôt provide any sweat reduction.

Eco Brick?,"So I recently washed out a milk jug and figured I'd use it to start an eco brick. The only thing though, is that I can't use them to build anything, I just thought having all my plastic in one container where animals can't choke on them would be better than them possibly being loose and eaten.

Am I actually doing anything helpful by doing this?","eco bricking is great. yes it has a positive impact for species. no please dont ship it. once its full toss it. recycling programs vary vastly! visit your local recycling center, or check out their website to understand what they currently recycle. brick anything they cant handle. you aren't diverting but you are compacting. my two cents: it can be worse for the environment to drive odds and ends to be recycled at different locations than to brick it. get informed, use your best judgement. no hard and fast rules, no absolutes, no judgement, no guilt. || Depends, was any of that plastic recyclable? || I think if you should only put non-recyclable bits in there but ultimately you can recycle a lot of things which imo would be better than preserving them (to me, you‚Äôre delaying landfill waste instead of diverting) || I know I could just google it, but ELI5 eco brick please? || Eco Bricks are a complete waste of time. Using it physically as a brick is worse than incinerating it or landfilling it.

Then you see people cleaning up the macroplastics and shoving them into freshly made plastic trash bags that are sent to the dump. It seems like there isnt any real progress being made to reverse or even slow the growth of plastic pollution. || Do the things that an average person can reasonably do (like getting rid of plastic utensils, food containers and nonstick pans, buying clothes made from natural materials, etc) meaningfully affect personal exposure to pfas/microplastics?

What I just realized about a common recycling argument I hear‚Ä¶,"Sometimes family or friends will argue recycling doesn‚Äôt make a big difference compared to XYZ or if they started they‚Äôre just 1 person blah blah blah. But I never thought to bring up littering. Most mature adults never litter. Even though one person not littering doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference, they know how out of control it can get and therefore don‚Äôt do it to just be part of making the world better. Maybe they can see the parallel to that with recycling ‚Ä¶.","I remember being 12 and having a teacher trying to tell us about the importance of buying local and organic, and I was like, ""Why does it matter, I'm just one person?"" and she came back with some heat and said, ""And that's why nothing ever changes! Everyone just assumes their small part means nothing, and the world goes on as it is. And that's your choice to make.""

God bless her, she rocked my shit in that moment and changed my whole worldview forever. Keep trying to plant seeds, sometimes they do take root and change everything. 18 years later and I'm on my way to be a farm educator at a bioregenerative farm, lol, teach kiddos about food systems and soil health and all

Another extremely powerful image to me is specific to growing up in the Southern Baptist church, but on Christmas Eve we would begin the service in the dark sanctuary, with only 1 candle lit at the altar. In our pews, each of us was holding a little, unlit candle. One person would approach the candle at the altar, light their own candle, then descend down and light his neighbor's. That neighbor would then turn to the person next to him and light theirs, and then she would light her neighbor's, and so on and so on. 

And after just a moment, the entire room was lit by a sea of itty bitty glowing candles. And it just began with one small candle lighting its neighbor's. 

Keep fighting the good fight. Sometimes you're not around to see how the seeds you scatter turn out, and we often have no idea if we are watering seeds someone else was thoughtful enough to plant. I think your analogy is a useful one, and that analogy and metaphor are powerful teachers for many || Once my brother threw something out the window while we were driving so my mom pulled over and had him pick up as much trash as he could find. And I think we need to use that teaching method more. || My art teacher gave us the best Do Your Part speech I‚Äôd ever heard.

She showed us this fabulous Pointillism painting, and kept zooming in until it was just dots. Each dot is individually tiny, but together they make something amazing. || While it does some good, it also serves a sort of modern ritualistic purpose. While one may think that recycling makes people more complacent about other forms of environmental action, it actually serves as a daily reminder via habit of the importance of taking care of the world around us. || One person throws trash on the side of the road in front of my house. I believe it‚Äôs one person because it‚Äôs always the same beer cans and fast food trash. One person can do a lot of damage. If I ever catch that mothereffer. || I'm sorry, but any adult that uses excuses like these isn't entering the discussion with good faith. They know they dont want to recycle, they're making up excuses rather than giving a legitimate rebuttle, and it's very unlikely you can convince them to do otherwise. I'd love to be proven wrong, though. The more people you convince to make a change, the better. || I was volunteering on a nature reserve and we were discussing this. The man running it told me about the parable of the boy and the starfish.


The story goes something like this. There was a big storm, and it washed up thousands upon thousands of starfish on the beach. A boy was picking his way along the shore, grabbing starfish one by one and chucking them back into the ocean. A man came up to him and asked,


""Why are you doing this? You'll never save all the starfish!""


The boy continued to throw starfish into the sea, and said,


""Maybe, but I can save this one,"" splash ""and this one, "" splash ""and this one."" Splash.


Your actions might not solve the whole problem, but we all have to unravel our own corners. Every plastic bottle you don't buy reduces demand for them a little, and increases demand for an alternative. || The thing I hear is that it all ends up in a landfill anyway so there‚Äôs no point. I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs true (at least not where I am and not everywhere) but it seems to be a common sentiment. || I try to buy packaging that is recyclable (where I live, in France, it's plastic packaging numbered 1 or 2), but other than plastic bottles for milk or washing up liquid (for example) I try to buy loose fruit and vegetables and tins which are recyclable.

Unfortunately, my SO always puts potatoes in a plastic (albeit compostable bag). We don't even buy that may any once; maybe 3 or 4 large ones. He'll buy two onions and bag them... || Litter was the original issue that started recycling.  Remember that ‚Äúcrying Indian‚Äù commercial?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0sxwGlTLWw&pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD Keep America Beautiful: The Crying Indian (1970) - YouTube

That lead to Keep America Beautiful. 

Which lead to bottle bills in some states. || I recycle like I'm supposed to, and then the people I'm depending on to make that process work just landfill it, burn it, ship it to Kathmandu anyway because it wouldn't make a corporation a profit. Nothing I do affects that at all, all I can do is fill the right bins.

I produce a *negative* amount of litter because even if someone else litters, I can take personal, direct action against that problem. || I get where you‚Äôre coming from, but this isn‚Äôt a strong argument to me.

Actively putting garbage in a place that looks otherwise clean is well-kept is a significantly worse offense than, say, smoking in that same well-kept place-

One leaves a visible mark that hangs around until dealt with, the other is invisible and minimal, and rapidly absorbed into the atmosphere.

Again, I get what you‚Äôre saying, and the net result is the same- but the psychological impact is significantly different. || Have the ""I'm just one person"" people ever donated money to a charity? Given $10 to the Red Cross after a natural disaster, or given money to their church, or bought a meal for a homeless person? Donated blood? You haven't cured cancer, solved world hunger, rebuilt all those flood-damaged houses, provided housing for someone, etc., with your one donation, but we do it anyway because it's the right thing to do. 

You aren't saving the world with recycling - even collectively, we aren't saving the world with recycling alone - but it's still the right thing to do.

Or to add to your analogy about littering: next time someone feeds you the ""it's just one piece of trash"" line or the ""I'm just one person"" line, find the nearest piece of garbage and throw it on their floor. It's just one piece of trash, right? Who cares. || ‚ÄúWorldwide, it‚Äôs estimated that 1.69 billion pounds of cigarette butts end up as waste each year.

What's the most sustainable toothbrush option?,"Before I do the deep dive I thought I'd see if someone else has done the work for me! 
Bamboo, cane sugar, electric? How do I know which is the best option? Ideally would love the bristles to be a compostable material too!","I think that no tooth brush would be zero-waste. I think that this is the sort of thing that you're absolutely forgiven for being wasteful and opting in for the option that keeps your teeth healthy. 

  
Seriously, you won't see people looking for ""zero waste insulin dispensers"" or ""zero waste bandages"". The small amount of plastic in a replaceable head for an electric brush is minimal compared to the other waste you can create and to the medical waste that would be created if you do not treat your teeth. || Also, I‚Äôve sent old toothbrushes and toothpaste tubes to the Oral B recycling program in the past. Not sure how actually good or helpful this is, but it‚Äôs a no cost to you thing that is low effort. 

https://oralb.com/en-us/recycling/

Not sure if it‚Äôs available in other countries || SURI has done a nice job in the electric category. || [Sea Turtle, LLC](https://seaturtlellc.com/)

This company's specializes in sustainable products, including toothbrushes. || Gia Guy has natural bristle bamboo handles ones that don't shed a lot of bristles when you use them. I use them for cleaning in tight spaces when too worn to be toothbrushes. || We use battery operated toothbrushes but we have a hazmat facility here so we can drop the batteries in a bag and drop off the bag when it's full of cords, broken appliances, batteries, etc. Our bathrooms and powder room are old and small so we're not big on electrical toothbrush setups. It would just look cluttery and unsightly. || Bamboo! || I use bamboo ones and then use the handles for garden stakes and plant labels. Close enough to zero waste for me || Hi, I don't like natural brittles. I settled for Yaweco brand with swappable heads. || I like what the Preserve team is trying to do! I also enjoy brushing my teeth with their toothbrush || I use Quip and they are supposed to be eco friendly. || I have a Suri toothbrush and really like it. Idk if it‚Äôs the most sustainable option, but my dentist recommended i use an electric toothbrush and this one is about as sustainable as it gets. It‚Äôs aluminum, repairable (allegedly, we will see), and you can send the brush heads back for recycling to them. 

I had a phillips sonicare before that and it broke and there were no options for repair, so i‚Äôm hoping this goes well. || I recommend the [NADA](https://trynada.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopVzbaOryDQdiRTNqQ1Jl1WNkVaqgf8o-YSSM2VwOouitwD6Xk0) toothbrush. It has an aluminium handle with replacement heads that they take back and recycle. || Definitely not electric. First, they use electric power for a task that can be done manually (coal-burning, gas-burning, or oil-burning), but they are made of plastic. Like a power mower, leaf blower, electric knife, electric egg-beater ... so many convenient machines have contributed to the waste stream. Second, of all synthetic materials, plastic is the hardest to recycle. Different kinds of plastic have to be separated, and so do the metal components. It's expensive and uses more power to complete the cycle. 

I use bamboo brushes. While they're not zero waste, they last a good long time and they are highly recyclable, low-impact environmentally. The ones I use have natural bristle. i get them from my local health-food store, but they're also available from Etsy. 

Note that most dentists and periodontists recommend soft bristles as being better for your gums. || Aren't bamboo toothbrushes with charcoal brittles plastic free? Somehow I always thought they were. I bought a local brand when I lived in my home country. I go through toothbrushes so quickly, because I apply a lot of pressure while brushing my teet, which kind of destroys the brittles ü´† || Tough one. I use an electric oral B toothbrush, which does generate the replacement heads as waste. I buy them in bulk to minimize packaging and I had my last oral B for like 15 years. I tried a manual toothbrush for a while which has better options for zero waste, but I my dental health tanked. I‚Äôm not sure which is worse, using a few of those brush heads per year or getting extra dental work, but assuming the latter is worse I switched back to electric. 

I did look up electric toothbrushes with compostable heads but they don‚Äôt seem to exist in any good way. || I love my electric toothbrush!! Cleans better and with less effort than a manual. Plus Panasonic will fix your toothbrush if it breaks, rather than buying a new one. Plus plus I got bamboo heads for mine!!! || Cane sugar is not anything to use on your teeth‚Ä¶.. || When my electric one bit the dust, I went back to the old style toothbrush...no batteries required. I bought bamboo ones. Loved them until I had a mouth full of loose bristles, indicating that it was time to use a new one.

Disappointed in Blueland,I‚Äôve used blueland for quite a while now and have been satisfied with them for a while. Never had any issues. Recently they started selling in target which is fantastic because I can get it while shopping and not have to worry about the impacts of deliveries. I‚Äôm disappointed because the Target packaging now has a plastic seal in it making it less eco friendly than getting it shipped‚Ä¶ ,"I find it a bit strange that laundry detergent in powder form, which has been around forever, isn't mentioned more often when discussing less wasteful household alternatives. I get Arm & Hammer powdered detergent from meijer that comes in a cardboard box. it does come with a disposable plastic scoop, but it's still much less wasteful than getting the plastic cartons of liquid detergent. || Yeah unfortunately a lot of Blueland's packaging contains PLA. They really like to pretend it doesn't, and you have to dig really far down in their website and FAQs to find it, but most of their packaging contains PLA and none of their products are BPI-certified for any type of compostability (home or industrial). || It probably has something to do with scaled up inventory shipping where it‚Äôs gonna spend more time in less controlled environments.  

I haven‚Äôt tried them myself yet, but Good.store recently added a section of cleaning products, including dishwasher tabs.  It‚Äôs a platform Hank & John Green put together, and profits go to different charities (coral reef alliance for the cleaning products). || Have you tried Jar the zero waste store in somerset? Not sure if they carry blueland products, but seems like they have some good options for local shopping. || We shouldn‚Äôt support target anyway || I really like Dirty Laundry liquid. They come in metal bottles that can be recycled and it‚Äôs HE so you not have to use a very small amount. 

Also I used to just use regular powder form detergent before I wanted to go to a less chemical version. || Just wanted to say this is a great thread with lots of great info, love this subreddit || Been boycotting Target for months anyway, I recommend joining the force || When they stopped making the facial cleanser, which I loved, and then the body wash. That's when I knew they were going downhill. They've definitely done some questionable things, but I can't say this surprises me. Which is frustrating, I used to genuinely like what they had to offer. || Over the years I've spent so much money buying different kinds of powdered detergent. Every time I try one it doesn't fully dissolve and it creates more hassle for me. I wind up throwing more away than I use. I even tried making my own powdered detergent and that didn't workout either. 

I've also tried several different types of washer sheets and have had issues with them fully dissolving. Again, I throw so much out because of frustration. I have 2 boxes in the cupboard to see if they work. I haven't been brave enough to try them yet. So I'm back to using a concentrated liquid. 

About 35 years ago our local Kimberly Clark paper mill used to produce a detergent sheet. It was a bright blue, when you washed with it it came out as a bright white nonwoven fabric. For an average sized load of laundry it only took about a 2 inch square. Laundry always came out nice and clean, very little smell. The people who worked in that department could bring it home for free, large sheets or ends. I didn't buy laundry detergent for years. Sure wish I could find that! The mill stopped producing it many years ago. The mill has been sold a couple of times and I can't find it anymore. 

I wish there was a good alternative to use without trying out so many different ones just to see if they work. I wind up spending money and throwing it away. || I tried SO hard with this company about 7 years ago or so and just couldn't. 

Their bottles were absolute shit and continually broke/cracked because the cylinder part was glued to the top domed part.

After the third broken bottle once again leaking product all over my cabinet bottoms, I gave up. I hope they've improved. || I actually e-mailed them about this & they replied saying the entire packaging, even that, breaks down completely as expected, so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Refills?,I‚Äôve heard refills are an alternative to minimize the amount of waste we produce after consuming a product but how is that? Majority of the refills come in plastic packaging so isn‚Äôt it just the same as purchasing another product? Wouldn‚Äôt the idea of a refill imply that I go to the store and fill my already existing container with more of the product via a machine? I‚Äôm having such a hard time switching to zero waste living when it comes to the skin and body care I use ‚òπÔ∏è,"As far I know, most refills will use less plastic for the one large container vs the 3+ individual packages that you would buy. Obviously this would vary item to item, but I feel like it‚Äôs true for most items I‚Äôve used. Especially for things like cleaning spray. The concentrates can make like 30+ full bottles of spray. Reusing a spray bottle vs buying 30+ plastic spray bottles with the same product inside saves on at least 29 bottles of plastic. Know what I mean? 
You can then also factor in the supply chain process too. I‚Äôm not super familiar with this, so I‚Äôll let someone else possibly chime in on that. || You may also have a refill store in your area, I know the one near me has large 5 gallon jugs that you get product from into your own container and they send the jugs back to be cleaned and refilled. And like the other commenter said, getting concentrated versions of things helps too || When it comes to a low waste lifestyle, I‚Äôm a firm believer in not letting perfection get in the way of the good and in just doing what I can where I can. There are certain categories of products I have not been able to switch to low waste, with skin care being one of them. And that‚Äôs ok! I have extremely sensitive skin and there are very few products that my skin reacts well to. If they don‚Äôt have refill options, so be it. For example, the sunscreen I use on my body has a jumbo size option so I go with that. My moisturizer does not, but I‚Äôm not going to eliminate it from my life as a result. I went down that path once before and it did not end well. 

Instead I focus on the categories that I have more wiggle room on - I go to my local refill store for cleaning products, soap, and detergent. I buy my clothing and furniture second hand etc. 

My main point is don‚Äôt stress yourself out trying to make every single product in your life sustainable, because in the grand scheme of things it‚Äôs more important to just be mindful overall and do what you can, where you can. || I get refills for our liquid dish detergent (I tried powder but it seemed like we went through it soooo quickly and it was a lot more expensive) from Grove Collective and it comes in aluminum packaging, so I‚Äôm much more confident that gets recycled compared to plastic.

For laundry detergent, we use powdered detergent (Nellies) and get the biggest bucket we can (which I think is 800 loads) which lasts us 1 year.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt find a bar shampoo that worked for my hair type, so I‚Äôm still using a liquid one, but I buy a big size so it takes a while to get through.¬†

Skincare I am just recycling the empties at Sephora (no clue if it actually gets recycled, but better chances than compared to my curbside program I think).¬† || The beauty industry has exploded due to influencers. OP my suggestion to reduce consumption is to dissect your beliefs about what you truly need versus what you are currently using. Only you can do this. No one should be telling you to stop using certain product. I‚Äôm simply encouraging you to consider if the reduction can happen through eliminating the product all together, rather than looking for alternatives. This goes for cleaning and paper products as well. Our habits and beliefs are deeply embedded. || You really have to be more specific about what item you're referring to refilling. There are liquid, gel, powder, etc refills... Cleaning tablet refills that you drop in containers and add water, for stuff like cleaning products. Large bottles of foam soap you can buy to refill glass soap foamers, vs buying a new plastic bottle of foam soap every time you need more. || There are certain products that make it easier. You can swap out Dr. Bronner's diluted for things like body soap, hand soap, and now they are selling those in paper cartons instead of plastic bottles. Lots of bar soaps come in paper packaging. ""Refills"" for cosmetics truly vary - some still come with a ton of stupid waste although allowing you to use the decorative outer packaging still saves some energy/plastic. Buying larger formats, swapping out what you can, and minimizing products that you don't actually need all of these help a little bit. for me a big waste saver was single sheet masks. the convenience is great but the single packages were just so wasteful it got to me. I now get 30 packs in a little plastic box instead, and I use the plastic boxes for storage for other things around the house afterwards. || Refills are low waste:  
Specialty dispenser (spray, pump) takes more material to produce vs simple refill container.  
Reduces weight/space for shipping and the vehicles needed to store and move the items.  
Reduces the number of trips you need to make if buying in bulk.  
If you transport using a bicycle or low/zero emission further adds to the positive.  
But I also feel skin care is health related and compromising our health is not worth it in the long run. || One of the big problems I've encountered wrt zero waste is focusing on certain things too much. Skin and body care packaging is fine as a start, but really consider what waste you produce throughout your day, at work, home, going out etc and then look back at how much that all is compared to a shampoo bottle that you recycle every three months. || I've been seeing more and more dilutable solids sold as refills. I have tile cleaner in a reusable spray bottle that comes in a tablet in a paper envelope. My laundry detergent comes in sheets in a cardboard box. || I think my bathroom routine is pretty low waste but it takes time to find where you can source products that work for you. As someone else mentioned if you can see a professional about your skin care. Mine has been reduced considerably because I have a serum mixed for me, in glass, that I take back for refills. My cleanser and moisturizer are the same, refilled. I use a aluminum tube sunscreen that is recycled and the only waste is the little plastic cap. Bar soap, most of the time it isn't not even wrapped but if it is it's cardboard. I use a solid body moisturizer, bar shampoo/conditioner and solid toothpaste. This didn't happen overnight. I've been stinky and used so many low waste deodorants that I had to finish up before I found NoPong (which works for me). Be patient, find your favourites that suit your body and do your best.¬† || You could check in with local artists if they could use the glass bottles for their artwork.

Also, check with local recycling centres or businesses to see if they have a glass crusher which turns glass into sand. See if they could crush them for you. Often this sand is used for horse trails or other projects of the like. 

With the variety of products in each category, at least in the US, having refill centres would be difficult. Having the storage space would be an undertaking and the few number of centres would make accessibility a challenge. It is a nice dream though. 

You might look at Grove or other companies who are looking to minimise the amount of plastic waste they produce. Some may be there already, but others are working toward that goal with a set date for accomplishment. Also, as others have stated, concentrates will help. 

Yes, there will be plastic waste when you pick up larger bottles of products that only come in plastic, but there is a huge difference between one larger bottle vs ten, twenty, thirty smaller bottles. || Not sure where you are but check your city for a refillery. We have a couple and they‚Äôre wonderful. Food, cosmetics, bring your own container and pay by the ounce usually. || Some products are using ‚Äúrefills‚Äù as a method of greenwashing, so be careful and remember that not all refills are created equal.  There was a cosmetic packaging expert on YT who did a video about this, but I can‚Äôt remember her name.  Effective refills use less packaging compared to the traditional packaging, but some refills may not be recyclable whereas the original type of packaging may be.  If you have a refill store near you that lets you refill your own containers, that‚Äôs better than commercially available refills, but commercially available refills can still decrease the amount of plastic packaging used.  For some types of refills, the benefit is only seen once you‚Äôve refilled enough times as well, so I just wouldn‚Äôt take a company‚Äôs word for it. || I recently discovered that Cerave has refills of their facial cleansers. The refill pouches say they're 77% less plastic than buying another bottle. || I could buy 4 different 6-8oz pump bottles of hand soap with the associated plastic and metal waste. I could also buy one pump bottle of hand soap and a refill bottle which is good for anywhere between 3 and 5 refills depending on brand. That‚Äôs a lot of pump bottles that aren‚Äôt tossed. || Joining a co-op that purchases things by the barrel wouldn't seem so odd if we didn't divide residential and non-residential space so thoroughly. || I have a refill store with a big bulk section. I bring my own jars and fill them. It really does cut down on waste. || What country and state? My state has many refill shops with a good selection of skin and hair care.
My fav hair products are made by DIP from Sparta NJ. || saw this at my local grocery store this week! it‚Äôd be coool if this were the future of refills

Just discovered coconut sponges and I'm kinda obsessed?,"Okay so this is probably gonna sound weird but I'm genuinely excited about a SPONGE lol

I was getting so frustrated with how fast my regular sponges were falling apart (and probably scratching up my pans without me realizing). Then I randomly came across coconut fiber sponges and decided to try them.

GUYS. Game changer.

These things have lasted me like 2 months so far and they're still going strong. My regular sponges used to last maybe a week? Plus they clean just as well but don't scratch anything.

I did some googling after and apparently the coconut fibers are naturally antimicrobial too which is pretty cool.

Feeling defeated,"I have been trying my best to start making better decisions in terms of waste. im pretty set on the personal care products and cleaning supplies but now i just saw that glass actually isnt recycled bc its too heavy/expensive? i thought it was infinitely recyclable. ive made a point to make a switch to a few different glass products now i just feel like im not making a difference at all. i try my best to make the best choice ethically for people, animals, and the environment but society has other plans. i see a lot of suggestions to find other uses for glass jars, but i live in a very small apartment and this just isnt practical. my city accepts glass recycling, im just concerned that its not actually being recycled at all now. i need some advice/guidance bc its making me want to give up","I hadn't heard that about glass, but even if it does end up in a landfill or litter, it isn't going to harm the environment too much in terms of leaching chemicals or plastics into the water, etc. Also I dont know this but I wonder if the volume of glass they get factors into the equation if things get recycled. Like if they get a lot, maybe it's more profitable to actually recycle it. I dont know, but I wonder if you could contact someone in the city and see if they would explain their processes? || Glass is recyclable but not everywhere.  It‚Äôs a question of markets: finding someone to buy the glass who can do something useful with it to make enough money.  

But glass is also very reusable.  You can research thousands of beautiful DIY projects with glass beyond food storage. || It's hard to be sure if materials are all being recycled, but you can probably find out more about the actual recycling rate for glass and plastic in your city. 

I'd still stick with glass for a couple of reasons: some of it is almost certainly being recycled, if not all. It is much easier and cheaper to recycle glass than plastic, for several reasons, so if your city is failing to recycle everything, it's probably the plastic that's failing.

Plastic is made from petroleum, so the upstream source material is already worse. That alone makes glass better. 

Plastic produces off-gassing as it deteriorates, an unmeasured, unknown form of toxic waste. So microplastic in the environment (or in your body) is doubly nasty. Glass is inert. 

I also live in a small apartment. For me, this subreddit is somewhat aspirational. I've done well in some areas, not so well in others.

Don't let the best be the enemy of the good. Stick with it. Do what you can. Over time you'll continue to find places to improve. 

Someone on this sub told me where to find Dr. Bronner's liquid soap in paper cartons. I love Dr. Bronner's, so even though I usually avoid Whole Foods like the plague, I went over there and bought a bunch of cartons to refill my bottles. A small thing, but it pleased me. :-) || I worked in recycling for several years so yes, glass is recycled AND no, glass isn‚Äôt recycled (Schrodinger‚Äôs glass jar?) due to some of the reasons others have mentioned. 

A few of things to consider:
Glass is very heavy to process which makes it inefficient (and hazardous if broken)to recycle. Glass is made from sand so there is plenty of sand around‚Äî there is no real value to it‚Äî transporting them is another form of greenhouse gas emissions that contributes to climate change. 

Glass should be reused as much as possible before it must be recycled. Others have mentioned reuse/refill and that is what I do with glass containers. If you have a local refill store, bring them your jars so people can refill without having to buy packaging. 

Glass in the landfill is much better than plastic, compost, aluminum‚Äî by a long shot. 

If you want to look into recycling, source separated recycling is best. This means collecting a lot of glass (no lids/etc) and dropping off at a reputable source that only processes glass. Depending on where you are, your local municipality can help you find a source. Some orgs, like glass half full in Nola, is doing just that‚Äî and I love them to death for it. 

Hope this helps!!! || I highly recommend you look into companies that make refillable products where you can keep the same glass jar. I love Activist Skincare and Etee for refillable skincare options. || You could always safe the glass bottles and buy things in bulk. Theres brands like Ecover, Miniml and Faith in Nature, which you can order huge bottles of and store in a cupboard, then pour into the smaller glass bottles to use. I know some of the companies take the huge bottles back for refilling once emptied, or you can take them to a refill store and do it yourself and get as much as you want. So you wouldn't have to throw anything away, just make sure the glass bottles get a good clean and then label them so you're not mixing any chemicals || Please be encouraged.

Is it true reusable grocery bags take more energy to produce than plastic bags ever would?,"I‚Äôve heard that reusable cloth or canvas grocery bags require so much energy and resources to produce that you‚Äôd have to use them hundreds of times before they actually become ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for the environment than single-use plastic bags.



Is that accurate? I‚Äôd love to see data or studies on this... curious how it balances out over time.","In addition to all the other comments shared - energy use in production is not the only consideration. I live near the ocean and we have tremendous problems with plastic bags getting in water ways. They get washed/blown away at every step from the store to the landfill, then they get caught is trees and washed into rivers. Then animals eat them, and they shed microplastics into the water system, eventually making it into our drinking water. || [deleted] || My personal idea has always been that even though a reusable bag takes a lot more resources to make, I'm reducing the volume of waste I'm sending the to landfill (because it's hard to recycle the plastic and it gets thrown away).¬†


Here is an article that introduces some things to think about: https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/sustainable-shoppingwhich-bag-best/¬†


It seems like there's not really one true answer because it depends a lot on what type of bags, what recycling programs you might have, etc. || https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/13/world/reusable-grocery-bags-cotton-plastic-scn

I think the main takeaway that I have is to just reuse stuff as much as possible, whether that‚Äôs a plastic bag or a reusable tote. If I don‚Äôt have one of my reusable bags with me, I try to get paper bags or not use a bag at all. 

I think too it depends on what your bags are made of. As the article mentions, cotton bags for example require a huge amount of water and such in their production. But I assume that‚Äôs not the same for bags made from other items. || It‚Äôs not just production you have to take into account but also afterlife. A cotton bag will always be better than plastic if you add that. || That‚Äôs a weird way to frame the conversation, to be completely honest. It‚Äôs very oversimplifying, even if it is the case. Making a reusable grocery bags is not a large scale drain on energy resources. Especially compared to things like AI processing. The problem with plastic bags isn‚Äôt so much the energy that goes into producing them, but the product left behind that is a piece of garbage that will take thousands of years to biodegrade. || I think the whole conversation about it is insincere. Not you OP of course, but the information the companies put out. 

It's a lot of lobbying and propaganda.

They'll put out something shocking like, 
""You'd need to use it thousands of times!"" Without showing the direct comparison to if you'd used single use bags instead. And that's a one to one comparison they ignore. My reusable bags hold 2-3x the amount of groceries. So do I count each trip as two trips because it's two bags? And the way people bag milk and similarly heavy items locally. It's usually double bagged. Plus at the end you'll see a number like, ""52 uses,"" which is the more appropriate number to use.

Do I count my reusable bags by use, or by replaced uses? 

And the ones that blame consumers for some big companies switching to using reusable bags as single use in places where single use bags are banned? Doubly insincere. They're trying to tell me that a company finding a loop hole to hurt the environment is everyone's fault who shops there, but the company doing it? 

I don't see these companies saying how often those thick plastic shampoo bottles should be reused. Or the plastic wrap on pallets. Nothing on the company end is listed ever, *except* when they feel they can blame the consumer.

The newest bags I have are some target bags from the pandemic and a bag I caught during a windy day. The oldest bags I have are an over 20 year old tote and a jean bag I made from some unrepearable jeans.

But, if it does concern you still. And I completely understand if it does. Check out your local thrift store! They usually have random cotton or similar shopping bags. That starts you at neutral because it was at risk for the garbage. || Not supporting the plastic bag industry is another reason. You are decreasing overall consumption of plastic bags. 

I also find that not having excess plastic bags lying around leads me to be more likely to find more sustainable, zero-waste ways to do other things. Eg, if I don‚Äôt have a plastic bag for my wet swimsuit, I‚Äôll just roll it up in my towel til I get home. If I‚Äôm gathering stuff to give away, instead of filling used plastic bags and dropping those off, I put the stuff in a reusable bag or a basket and unload it at the thrift store. I think these tiny habits, good or bad, add up to larger decisions about how to live life. || I‚Äôve heard that about multi-use plastic bags. That said, I bought some anyway a few years ago, and even if it did take 100 uses to break even, I‚Äôve done that and more. But the energy/resources used would vary widely depending on the bag and manufacture process. An upcycled T-shirt bag would win ‚Äúmost green‚Äù award. || Not in my world‚Ä¶I‚Äôve been using the same grocery bags for close to a decade now. I can‚Äôt even imagine how many thousands of bags they‚Äôve saved. || First of all, focus on cotton, jute, or other organic materials for bags. Some 'reuseable' bags are still made of plastics, and you have to reuse them a lot to make them better than the plastic grocery bags. 

I have cotton cloth bags and a traditional basket for my shopping. I always use the same ones. I also put my refillable containers in the basket when they are empty. I do most of my shopping at a refill store, so that makes it even better. || Big oil would say yes.  Common sense, and making your own bag (or having a friend who sews make it), from an old sheet or pillowcase would tell you absolutely not.  Use an old bag from a thrift store.  Never ever will a brand new plastic bag (think of how many you could possible use over your lifetime) take less energy than using a bag that already exists, and we all know there are PLENTY of existing receptacles that can be used as a grocery bag.  Think basket, backpack, soft side cooler, empty grocery box from that store (I nab a box in stores if I need more bags than I brought), pillowcase, suitcase (hey, desperation calls for creativity), or anything that can hold your items.  Don't listen to the marketing team that tells you otherwise. || IDK, sounds like something big plastic would say‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been using my washable canvas/cotton bags for well over a decade now, so I‚Äôm sure that wouldn‚Äôt be true in my case, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Plastic is poisoning us all, so I try to avoid it whenever possible. || I have a couple cotton bags I bought in 1991. Just used them today, still going strong. That's about 1500 weeks, so for sure, many hundreds of uses. || Most reusable bags you see at stores are made out of shitty plastic anyway and they do fall apart before they've been used enough times to be worth it. If you're using a legit cloth bag,¬† that's probably different || ?? I do use them hundreds of times. I go shopping like once a week so two years of use is 104x. Then I also use them as my work bag since they're waterproof and I can't have zippers on my work bag (dirt clogs and breaks them within 6 months) so that bag gets another hundred uses, since I use them until they're totally broken. Then I also like using some for storage, or we do combo storage and/of shopping like with the nice strong reinforced bottom panel kind.¬†


Whereas otherwise I would receive a dozen plastic bags per trip, and I don't even buy that much but some needs double bagged. Out of those, maybe I can find a re-use for two? So that's 520 plastic bags I would have tossed per year.¬† || It‚Äôs not so much about the energy it produces but the waste of plastic and how long it takes to break down. 1000 plastic bags to 1 reusable bag that you keep for many years balances out any ‚Äúenergy issue‚Äù. || It's not just the resources, but also the trash left behind. If you calculate the amount of trash by volume or weight, a reusable bag works for itself long before it's viable in resources. And there is also the decomposing part, especially if your bag is made from something natural, like cotton or linen. || Using 100 times is... kinda not a problem? That is the exact point. Like if you only go once or twice every week you'll offset the cost already compared to disposable in less than a year.

I have a cloth reusable bag I've been using for 4 years now and it's still as good as when I got it. And I use it not only for groceries, but also for moving stuff, to store snacks when we go on trips etc...

If your reusable bag breaks after only a few times, you don't have a reusable bag. You have a slightly more durable disposable bag. || It‚Äôs probably true that a lot of reusable items take more energy to produce than their single-use counterparts when you consider one use to one use, but if you‚Äôre reusing them over and over, ant some point the reusable item is going to use less per use than the single-use one.  It‚Äôs better to think of it that way.  That‚Äôs how I think about buying clothes.  I can buy a cheap clothing item that will last maybe a year of washes, or I can buy a more expensive version that will last the rest of my life.  If you consider cost per wear, it usually ends up being cheaper per wear over the life of the garment to buy a higher quality item.",269,ZeroWaste,2025-06-16 22:19:43,true reusable grocery bags take

Re-use waste: Wash veggies before peeling. Cook the peels and you have a bullion you can freeze and use later.  Preferably organic. Bonus taste if you have meat and you cut off some fat or skin or tendons.

Potato peels are not good into the bouillon, but you can season and bake them. Free chips.

One shocking thing - trash bags are useless. You buy plastic bags to throw them into trash. Stop using them. Just clean your bin and put the egg carton to the bottom of the bin to avoid scraping sticky icky stuff from the bottom.

Dead batteries are not always dead. Most of them can power a wireless mouse for months before they really die.

If you have garden - compost. Even if you do not grow veggies or fruits, you can use the compost on flowers.

I have 2 types of paper for my printer - classic white for very important documents and the recycled for the rest.

Used ground coffee with coconut oil is amazing substitute for peeling cosmetics. Also, worms and bugs love coffee, make sure to throw some into compost or even garden.

I collect water from my AC condensation  and water plants with that. When too much water is condensed, I flush the toilet with that water.

I use dryer only during winter or when it is raining.

Dishwasher can save water, but adding polish is useless, in my opinion. || I recommend using up what you've got before committing to something new.

I recommend playing The No Buy Game and seeing if you can solve the perceived problem a different way before buying something new. For example the straw you mentioned? Just drink from the rim of the vessel.

I recommend buying used before buying something new, no matter how ""natural materials"" it is.

I recommend understanding the difference between Montessori-aesthetic natural materials and true sustainability before buying something new.

I recommend trying to avoid being in that situation to begin with, before buying something new. For example, leftover containers means you bought too much prepared food. Try buying a smaller size instead. Or rather than bringing a picnic kit with you in case a spontaneous picnic were to erupt around you, take a good look at the likelihood of that happening and plan to bring items from home accordingly. In my case I've had two cases of a spontaneous picnic erupting near me in the past 365 days and while I did use my reusable flatware, there was no real need to as everything was finger foods. || My overarching philosophy is that any change you make has to be sustainable: that is, you must be able to sustain it.¬†


There is no point in declaring that you will shop exclusively from the bulk bins at a zero waste supermarket an hour away when you have a normal supermarket 15 minutes away. There's no point in declaring you'll use toothpaste tablets or bar shampoo when you find actually you don't like them that much.¬†


For a few swaps that potentially aren't the most zero waste that I made:


- I still use liquid shampoo, liquid dishsoap, and liquid laundry detergent, but I refill my own containers from my local refill shop! Yes, I am paying for extra water, but I have tried the alternatives and don't like them.
- I sometimes use a tampon, and I don't have a cup. I usually use my washable pads, but occasionally I want inside protection (very occasionally, I've had the same box of tampons for like 3-4 years and it's still mostly full), and I simply don't need that often enough to justify a cup. I also have medical issues where a cup is not something I'm quite ready to try.
- I buy toothpaste in an aluminium tube!

Why do even ‚Äúclean‚Äù hair products still use scent?,"I've been trying to simplify and reduce the number of products I use ‚Äî and fragrance-free has become a priority. But even among sustainable or ""clean"" brands, the haircare options are always scented.

Is it just a branding thing? Or do we just assume hair has to smell good?

Would love to hear from anyone who's gone truly scentless ‚Äî especially if you‚Äôve found a good styling product or leave-in.","I suspect the primary season is that the active ingredient chemicals used to make the product have their own scent and so they have to mask it in some way or else your hair would smell like the weird chemicals. 

Along the lines of your question though I've read an interesting case study of Febreeze when they were starting out... Febreeze is made to actually eliminate odors, not just mask them so their original product was unscented. It was incredibly effective and worked as described but the problem was you don't notice the absence of something, like a bad smell. The product was working but since the end result was 'no smell', it was hard to appreciate the improvement in users lives. By adding scent to the product, it would still eliminate the bad smells but now it left behind a slight perfume. This was noticeable and users reported they could 'smell' the cleanliness. The product exploded in popularity and came to be what we know it now. || Plaine products has unscented shampoo and conditioner (and I believe body lotion iirc).

I have had good luck with them overall, and I will say it is super easy to ship back your empties if you‚Äôre on the subscription. 

I didn‚Äôt love their leave-in, but the rest of their products have been good to me. You can buy a lot of it in bulk/gallon size now too, if you don‚Äôt want to commit to full subscription. || Probably because consumers want it. Strange that there isn‚Äôt an unscented option for most big brands. I know Sprouts store brand has unscented for most things at least last time I checked but I haven‚Äôt bought from them in awhile. Or maybe that was Whole Foods lol || ‚ÄúFragrance allergy is the most common cause of cosmetic contact dermatitis.‚Äù

I went truly scentless when I stopped using anything on my hair. Just water under the shower. || It's because many personal care products don't smell very good when totally unscented.  They usually have a chemical smell or an organic smell. || Flora Flora Co has unscented versions of all their shampoo and conditioner bars, if you're looking! || Look into detergent shampoo bars or soap shampoo bars. Can definitely find them unscented. If you try a soap shampoo bar, you might want to finish with an apple cider vinegar rinse to seal the cuticles back down. Soap is by nature alkaline (but detergent can be pH neutral) and there are hair types that do NOT do well with it.

PLUSH Toilet Paper that IS NOT Who Gives A Crap? (US-based),"Everyone else in my house will only tolerate the very plush, premium, top of the line, nicest type of Charmin toilet paper. If the nicest Charmin is a 10, Who Gives A Crap--the virgin bamboo option--is maybe, maybe a 3 to them at best. 

I know I'm not going to get a 10 here, but are there any low/zero waste brand you can recommend that will get me to a 7 or 8? I will even take brands that come in plastic packaging but might otherwise be sustainable (see next sentence).

I have the NRDC most environmentally friendly list and yes, I could just go down the list and try them all, but I started doing that and it's mostly been a frustrating trial and error process. I was hoping folks had some other brands they could share. 

And even if we get a bidet, we still need TP - we will not be using reusable cloths to wipe, period.","I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not good enough for your fancy-bottom family (just a little gentle teasing). But FYI, WGAC recently changed up their regular (not bamboo). It‚Äôs a bit thicker/nicer than it was. || Reel bamboo toilet paper is good. It's not as posh as Charmin, but it's a lot better than any of the other bamboo and recycled toilet papers we're tried. It comes in cardboard boxes (which make excellent storage boxes for up to 17 pint-size canning jars) without any plastic packaging. || Caboo is nice, 100% bamboo, ships in cardboard and is paper wrapped!  

Whole foods has small packs if you want to try before you buy a bunch, but definitely better price if ordered direct from Caboo if you like it....Actually looks like Costco online has the best price on Caboo currently! || Have you tried the 3 sea shells? || I personally really like Reel! || I haven‚Äôt used charmin a very long time and I didn‚Äôt think Who Gives a crap was that bad so take this with a grain of salt. We‚Äôre using Grove Co toilet paper right now and find it good enough. Especially with a bidet because you‚Äôre not doing hard wiping. || Charmin is gross. IDK how people can wipe with that stuff. ü§£ Good luck! Hopefully you find something satisfactory for your family‚Äôs tushies. ||  Absolutely no judgement but just a warning especially if there are women in your home: the more plush the TP, the more it's been chemically treated to be that way. There are few rules on what they can and can't use, and no requirement to disclose. Tons of women are thinking they have chronic yeast infections when actually it's dermatitis caused by trace chemicals on wet paper coming in contact with mucosal tissue. || My family seemed to prefer the cheapest single-ply non-absorbant super-thin wax-papery stuff (it's Japan -it's worse than you think), and would typically blow through a half roll in a single sitting. I finally set a rule to only ever buy two-ply that was actually absorbant. It took them months to learn that now you didn't have to blow through a half roll in a single sitting. Old habits die hard.

Can someone explain this?,"These paper plates are sold in California, they have BPI certification and they even say they are good for home composting. My question is why it says also that it‚Äôs compostable except in California? My trash company in CA (CR&R) even accepts compostable plastic bags in the compost bin for the organic waste composting program. Why wouldn‚Äôt these paper plates be able to be composted if they accept compostable plastic bags?","If they claim to be compostable or biodegradable, for sale in California, they have to provide proof that it composts/biodegrades under normalish circumstances. 

This is a law to prevent greenwashing.

If it isn't home-compostable, or only biodegrades in perfect conditions, they can't claim on the package that it is, and then sell it in California. || California has stricter laws around what can be labeled as compostable! https://calrecycle.ca.gov/plastics/labeling/ || i know this doesn‚Äôt answer your question, but i doubt that‚Äôs home compostable based on the shine on the plate. home compost doesn‚Äôt reach the necessary heat to break down bio plastic || Most likely legislation in california is different and this plate is not made according to those legislations. Selling is a different thing. || CA made it difficult to greenwash. Plastic is not compostable. || It's not actually compostable, they're just not allowed to lie about it in CA || Why can't we have the same safety regulations as California, this is horrifying || There's lots of confusion here in this thread, but the comments here are partially correct around California having stricter standards for what can be called compostable. However, as you can see and others have mentioned, this plate is certified BPI compostable, which is under current California law is allowed to be called compostable as it tests the product for compostability under the ASTM 6400 standard. 

The main issue is that new California legislation, SB 54, is going to change this so that BPI certification isn't enough to qualify as ""compostable"". This is mostly because these BPI certified plates or other foodware often use a PLA or compostable plastic lining to prevent it from getting soggy and wet. Pre-SB 54, this would have been OK because compostable plastic that is BPI certified is OK to be called compostable. However, SB 54 will change this--starting next year, no compostable plastic will be allowed to be described as ""compostable"", only 100% fiber-based material. 

This is because more and more garbage and composting companies are finding it hard to compost these ""certified compostable"" plastic products. In a nutshell, the conditions used to determine compostability under ASTM 6400 have become different than actual conditions at composting facility--mainly that the facilities are turning over compost piles a lot faster than the testing labs, mostly to make more of a profit by processing more material. You'll find that while your garbage company technically accepts compostable plastic bags, more likely than not, that material is causing issues downstream in the composting process, and they are starting to push back on this. Many companies in the Bay Area, for example, have started to announce that they are no longer accepting these bags in their composting bins. 

So bottom line here is that the company that made those plates is trying to get ahead of the curve by plopping this disclaimer on their plates because in a year or so, these plates won't be able to be called compostable in California.

Mechanical or wooden pencils?,"Im going back to school in the fall and am wondering. Which is more eco friendly. Wood is bio degradable but requires trees to be cut down. Mechanical pencils are reusable but usually plastic. Metal is nice but probably has a higher carbon footprint than plastic and equally likely to get lost. So, what do you use?","I‚Äôve been averaging about 15 years out of my metal mechanical pencils before I lose them. Without any heavy science to back it up, I‚Äôd say that it‚Äôs important to keep waste in mind by using either wood or long-term mechanical pencils, but neither is going to generate a significant amount of waste. || Honestly this is one of those things that I say do what is comfortable in your hand. I've only used plastic and mechanical pencils since elementary school and the same ones. I'm in my 40s and still have the ones from elementary.¬† || If you loose track of pencils often then wooden. If not, mechanical. || My metal Staedtler mechanical pencil is 25 years old. If you are studying science or engineering you will definitely need ink pens too || A full metal mechanical pencil will probably be better in the long run, especially since the metal can be melted down again and doesn't break down into harmful chemicals or something.


Also, I don't think a metal pencil has a higher carbon footprint.¬† || I got a box of wooden pencils 2 and a half years ago and have barely made a dent in them, each one lasts a really long time before it's too short to keep using. I prefer them to mechanical personally. || I always preferred wooden pencils. I never liked mechanical pencils the look of them, the feeling of them not sure if due to neurodivergence, my sensory issues or something else. So I use wooden pencils. I think if you are type that losing pencils every other day then definitely get wooden ones

Also you can find pencils made of recycled paper which prob have lowest carbon footprint and better since it requires less new materials since it uses old paper for the barrel || I would use wooden pencils if I was picking just one. Unless you have a particularly heavy hand and need to sharpen constantly. 

Pencils can be purchased in cardboard boxes. Mechanical pencils tend to be packaged in plastic and refills come in plastic. 

For full disclosure I have both and like them for different things. They are very infrequently purchased (I‚Äôm still using what I bought over a decade ago) so I probably wouldn‚Äôt worry too much, unless I had reason to expect to replace them frequently. 

If you aren‚Äôt fussy about the specifics of the pencil put a shout out on your buy nothing group. Every year our school asks for supplies including pencils and sends the remainders home at the end of the year. I try to check what we have left before ordering for the new year and still somehow have a small collection of school pencils to give away. || My first thought is to make a parallel to trees. I did a Christmas activity with my Environmental Science students where we looked at plastic, reusable versus real, one-time-use Christmas trees. Through internet research, students found real trees were more environmentally friendly even though trees were killed because the plastic manufacturing process is worse overall. Granted, part of the decision was the ability to repurpose real trees after the holiday season.

At any rate, even though they might feel more wasteful, I‚Äôd say wooden pencils are better because they‚Äôre closer to carbon neutral. || I inherited my metal Staedtler lead holder - so with thicker lead than a typical mechanical pencil - from my late grandfather who used it since the 1950s in his architecture practice.

Let me sell you on why a lead holder, aside from the fact that they are all metal and last forever and you can pass it down to your progeny. The leads are thicker, like the thickness you'd find in a wooden pencil, which means they are less prone to breaking. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the same manufacturer providing me with raw graphite ""lead"" sticks to put into my pencil are the same who sell to those that make the wooden casing for wooden pencils. So there will be less waste with mechanical pencil thin lead cases, breaking the thin lead so having to run through them all the time, etc.

[Here are some examples of lead holders and leads.](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/lead-holders/) You won't find them in the typical office supply section of your grocery or general store. You'll find them in art supply stores. But, also, because they last so long, you'll be able to find them used. Ignore the lead pointer accessory, the thumb-press cap's inside will typically be a lead pointer and you don't even need one unless you are doing highly technical drafting work. || >Wood is bio degradable but requires trees to be cut down.

To my understanding, this is really only a ""bad"" thing if said trees aren't cut in a sustainable manner, and can actually be a ""good"" thing if done properly. Trees, by their very nature, absorb excess carbon out of the atmosphere and provide clean oxygen in exchange.

There are even some efforts to purposely grow and cut trees to then bury the wood as a form of carbon capture.

This isn't to say that wood resources should be misused, quite the opposite really. But so long as you're not like buying pencils sourced from the Amazon Rain Forest I honestly think you're fine. And even then, if the profits from sales are being put toward some conservation causes it could be argued to be alright, although personally I'd definitely be skeptical of any such pencils lol. || Mechanical all the way. Some of mine are 15-20 yrs old. Just have to figure out if you like 5 or 7 size lead! || I don't have anything that hasn't been mentioned from a zero waste perspective,, but if you do any drawing then you want wood pencils, as the lead is thicker and that makes it more versatile. || Really I think it‚Äôs what you have, what you use, and what you lose. Personally!
- There‚Äôs no good way for me to recycle any of the three currently so that doesn‚Äôt factor in.
- There are sone recycled wood pencils though I don‚Äôt know how big the difference is.
- I don‚Äôt tend to lose any in a litter way, just into my bag/among my things/giving them away, so I‚Äôm not terribly worried about them as litter.
- as I lose pencils easily, I find them a lot, too! This means purchasing leads
- I don‚Äôt buy the ones I won‚Äôt use || I got myself one of those nice af mechanical pencils for school back in 2014. I use it daily to this day, I even have the OG plastic protective sleeve. If you take care of quality things, you are doing your part. || Plastic will never be a more ecologically sound d option than wood. Most modern wooden pencils do contain glues which are likely to contain plastics but minimal compared to the mechanical pencils. || Don't jump on me. Many people have been given many useful advice so this is just an idea. If you have the fund, what about a tablet or iPad? 

I had an iPad for school that was my note, textbook, practice exam, worksheet,... for 3.5 years until someone broke my car window and stole my backpack (I told myself I will be right back but I took 30 minutes and that happened). I'm back to grad school now and if it wasn't for that incident, I would still be using that iPad for school. || I have both types and while the mechanical pencils are refillable, the replacement graphite is sold in plastic packaging. I haven't found a good use for the refill cartridges aside from as a fidget. And they don't make especially good fidgets. || I would say go with your preference but you could probably get your hands on used pencils and then you don't have to buy new. || Coming from the semiconductor industry - pencils are largely irrelevant.

Deodorant with Aluminum,"Why is it so hard to find a deodorant with aluminum in non plastic packaging? So many non aluminum options with cardboard type packaging or glass or metal, but haven‚Äôt been able to find anything with aluminum packaged this way. Anyone find anything? 

I used to be hardcore no aluminum, but after becoming more educated and sweating through most all other alternatives, I realized it helps me most and not as harmful as it has been made out to be. ","I really wish there wasn‚Äôt so much overlap between the ‚Äúeverything needs to be organic and chemicals are bad‚Äù market and the zero waste market. It‚Äôs the same problem with fluoride toothpaste. I want the active ingredient in my chemicals that has been shown to be safe while also not causing extra trash || You might have (marginally) better luck looking for eco friendly/low waste *antiperspirants*, rather than deodorants. || Good luck. As others have said, I hate the overlap between zero waste/eco friendly and pseudoscience. The average person doesn't need to avoid aluminum, or fluoride, or other hot topic ingredients. 

On that note,  I can't find any antibacterial cleaners that come as a concentrate or powder. But maybe antibacterial ingredients can't be made into a concentrate and reconstituted without losing effectiveness || I went down this rabbit hole a bit ago too and found the same thing - I'm just too sweaty a guy to NOT use aluminum based anti perspirant.

This was the best I could find - not zero plastic obviously but less plastic waste overall due to refills ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø and it does actually work as well as any of the other APs I've used previously

[Helmm ](https://www.helmm.com/products/v/scent-refill?formula=antiperspirantdeodorant) || I'm still mad about unilever discontinuing secret and old spice antiperspirant refills only a few months after I bought the containers for myself and my partner. || Same deal with toothpaste and fluoride. || No solutions, but definitely came to +1 everything you said! I made my own deodorant by adding some aluminum chlorohydrate to a standard DIY recipe ( https://www.etsy.com/listing/239935173/makingcosmetics-aluminum-chlorohydrate ) It works okay, but I'm an amateur who sweats buckets. I'd prefer to buy a stronger formula but hate the plastic packaging. || IVE BEEN SAYING THIS FOR YEARS like give me old spice in a cardboard tube PLEASE. I‚Äôve been using Harry‚Äôs since it works and they seem like not a terrible company || There are a few brands I know that have true aluminium antiperspirants in refills with varying degrees of plastic, that reduce but not eliminate plastic waste:

* [Helmm](https://www.helmm.com/products/v/starter-kit) that have refills in plastic packaging that they clain reduce waste by 70%. US based.
* [Estrid](https://estrid.com/products/antiperspirant), [Life supplies](https://lifesupplies.com/products/deodorant?variant=40150706487394), and [Make Waves](https://wearemakewaves.com/products/refillable-antiperspirant-natural-deodorant), but they're only available in Europe. || Nivea roll-on is in a glass bottle, cap and roller ball are plastic though. || You might try using an alum stone, they are made from potassium alum which has similar antiperspirant properties to what is more commonly used in antiperspirant deodorants. You can find them sold in cardboard boxes or in cloth bags and such. They also last a hella long time which helps cut down on waste. || Not sure if this has been said but apparently the aluminum is really sensitive to oxygen, so it'll deteriorate and be less effective in ZW/Eco packaging vs plastic or aluminum spray cans. 

I think Deo containers should be 100% recyclable at best if it's a chemical reaction problem. It still creates waste I guess but either that or having companies that offer more aluminum based refills || It‚Äôs still in plastic, but seems like less plastic‚Ä¶Kiehls antiperspirant. I‚Äôve been using it for 20+ years. Unscented. Works really well. A little goes a long way. It does have aluminum.¬† || Smol do. It's a proper, cardboard antiperspirant || Agreed! I read some articles and asked doctor and nutritionist, who said we ingest most of our harmful aluminum from instant cakes (box cakes) and grocery baked goods lolü§Ø || I‚Äôm looking for the same thing. Nivea rollon has aluminum and it‚Äôs in a glass bottle (with plastic lid). Some kind of solid in a cardboard wrapper would be perfect (I get lip balm in that packaging) || This isn‚Äôt quite what you are asking about, but I have also had trouble with natural deodorants and even aluminum antiperspirants (including extra strength) working. The only brand that I have been able to find that works (and even seems to prevent sweating) ended up actually being a natural deodorant in a glass jar from a company called Little Seed Farm. The options with charcoal seem to work the best. So while it isn‚Äôt an aluminum option, I mention it as someone who has struggled to find anything that will work.

I‚Äôm hurting over the amount of money wasted,"I calculated the amount of money wasted on Amazon as a result of throwing away food. Last year was really rough for me. I came down with a severe case of anxiety and it took several months to get better. At one point I thought it wouldn‚Äôt get better. In the meantime, food I would buy wasn‚Äôt being finished because I would get symptoms and need to go to the ER. I tried to avoid food that would give me symptoms. So it was about  $5,200  wasted.

With gaming I‚Äôve spent about $6,000 and I do not play most games and only a few of them partly because my anxiety would get in the way. So that‚Äôs another $3,000 or so. Another $5,000 or so for anything I haven‚Äôt covered like clothing that doesn‚Äôt fit me (lost weight) etc.

So I am having trouble putting this behind as I do not like wasting a single dollar. But here are some thoughts that help but haven‚Äôt fully done away with the regret of wasting:

1.I was sick so I should be so hard on myself.

2. Lesson learned: don‚Äôt buy in bulk ever again. Careful with the subscriptions on Amazon‚Ä¶

3. I made 8,000 on Robinhood so subtract some of the above from this 8,000. Of course my silly mind says I could have had more.

How do you guys deal or process having been wasteful?","Anxiety cost you a lot over the past year, have you been treated or are you taking meds for it? I think that might be a money saver || I am disabled by migraines and as they are unpredictable and severe, I waste a TON of food, and money on eating out. I hate it. I don‚Äôt like it. But unless I had a personal chef and shopper who could be ready to respond to my needs meal by meal, I can‚Äôt possibly avoid this. My migraines have robbed me so much of my life, my dreams and goals, my independence‚Ä¶ I mourn enough. I can not mourn the food or the money spent on food. I do not need that added guilt or shame or pain on a daily basis. I do my best to be thrifty and not create unnecessary waste in all other parts of my life and be content with that. I‚Äôll never be zero waste and that‚Äôs ok. I just do my best. And that‚Äôs ok.¬† || If you own those games that you bought, then you didn‚Äôt lose that money because you can still play them at any time. Just in case that relevant, I thought it would make me to make you feel better. || I stopped buying from Amazon a few years back. It‚Äôs one of the best things I‚Äôve ever done || From a mental health standpoint, I think one of the best things you can do is to take the times you're feeling good to ""prep"" for when you are not. For me, when I'm doing well, I may cook meals and freeze my leftovers so I have easy meals to microwave when cooking is just not going to happen. I also use ""feel good times"" to make sure my medications are refilled, doctors appointments are made, and to make sure I'm caught up on laundry and cleaning. I also try to remove things from my environment that encourage bad habits or are triggering when I'm not doing well. This could be deleting certain apps off your phone, getting rid of excess clutter, donating food/beverages that don't make you feel good, creating boundaries in certain relationships.... Whatever you need, take the time to check it and take care of yourself.¬† || Oh man. I totally feel for you, I just made my own post about being wasteful. But I haven't had the same struggles dealing. Anxiety is such a fucker, such a catch 22 at times. You're damned if you do damned if you don't. Need to develop coping mechanisms to deal with it. Not easy ü´Ç

Food waste is also a huge issue for me. More so because I've been hungry and desperate before, and more about the amount of food wasted from working in restaurants and kitchens. I wish it was all used to feed the hungry or homeless instead of trashed. Stores purposefully preventing stuff from being used is the worst. For my self, I feel better when I can let me pets eat what I can't. When that doesn't happen, I compost. Do you compost at all? Not all food items can be done. You can start with a tub under your kitchen sink, super easy! Look into vermiculture.

Have you tried it to give away food you can't eat? Please don't make yourself sick. I've been there myself but different reasons. Like I have GI dysmotility and am extremely volume sensitive. But stuff smells and tastes so good... It's hard to stop yourself even when you know the result isn't worth it. Today's pleasure outweighs tomorrow's pain.. But focus on alternatives.

Join local free cycle and swap groups. I fed raw diet to pets and foster animals, and I've picked up meat from people. Freezers that defrosted, too old for human consumption, unwanted organ meats, previous hunting season remnants. Offer stuff you can't eat in local groups. People might come get them, for human and furry family. Even if it's just a single day, someone out there may be struggling to put together dinner. Hopefully you can connect with others who can use what you cannot. And this goes for everything not just food, but of course food is the one with an expiration looming. || Therapy and Wellbutrin.


And a little grace. I didnt do it maliciously and I corrected myself when possible.¬†


I highly suggest therapy.¬† || I try to think of wasted money as the price of learning a lesson. Now you know, buying in bulk/subscriptions doesn't work for you. You need to also go easy on yourself, you didn't know you would be struggling. And I have also spent a little too much money on games when I was having a hard time...sometimes it's a way to help you just get through the day. I also struggle with anxiety, and medication has helped me immensely. || I cut myself slack when I am having bad health moment. I also try to remember that one health is more important two doing zero waste sometimes is better then not doing it at all. I agree with your idea of chalking it up as a learning experience for example I tried bubba tea other day and couldn‚Äôt stand it flavor and texture wise so throw out 2 almost full cups of it. I chalked it up to learning experience that bubba not for me. In areas were it easy I make switches and become more eco friendly. In areas where I can‚Äôt make switches that ok. No one should be themselves up cause of not being able to make eco friendly switches in some areas or having had a bad moment in life where they dropped the ball. We are all human. For example since sometimes I find it hard to cook and not waste food. I expect that be a waste in my life. I know that buying second hand clothes is easy for me to do so that area where I make it point to never get new clothes (besides underwear and bras) so I can be more eco friendly. 

Just pick and choose your battles with what areas your be eco friendly in. Some things aren‚Äôt worth it cause no eco friendly thing you do should cause negative affect on your health. For example you shouldn‚Äôt be cooking on a day when you‚Äôre in so much pain you might pass out just so you could save some food from going to waste. You need balance in life. Eco friendly things should add positive things to your life if you do them like for example using handkerchiefs are softer on nose and not as harsh as paper tissues and something that easy to use even on bad days for example. Hopefully that makes sense. 

Health is unpredictable. We will all have bad days and things wont go to plan and that ok. We can try agian tomrrow. 

I just had to learn to accept as someone with chronic illness that there a balance in life and I‚Äôll never be perfectly zero waster cause my health will require some waste.

Also therapy always helpful. 

Hope you‚Äôre feeling better and in better health. || All any of us can do is the best we can in the circumstances we're given. I'm currently caring for my young child in deep autistic burnout. All he will drink right now is sparkling water, and it's the only regulating sensory input he's getting. I refuse to feel guilty for the plastic bottles. You survived, that's the main thing. You had a crisis and either side of that you saved more waste than the average person I'm sure. || That's unfortunate. Health problems sure can throw a wrench in your food plans and finances. I've been there and it really sucks. Not only are you already physically suffering but also it's psychogically distressing. 

It is of course important to learn from your mistakes, and one way you seem to be doing this is by quantifying what you've wasted. But please don't beat yourself over it. 

You do need to work on some changes but the first step to change is self compassion. Only when you have compassion for yourself you can find solutions that work with who you are as a person and how your life is structured.

I'm obviously not you and live a very different lifestyle. I can't tell you what you should do about your situation, because what works for me isn't guaranteed to work for you. But I can share what works for me for reference.

I buy in bulk but I cook from scratch and have been doing so for decades so I know my consumption patterns. I haven't managed to go zero waste, but 99% of what I throw away are vegetable parts that I don't consider edible, and I have a good system for managing my produce.

I live alone. usually cook 5-6 servings of 2-3 tasty dishes that I'm genuinely looking forward to enjoy, and back it up with rice, oats, potatoes, sweet potatoes and hardy ""instant vegetables"" which may include cabbage, carrots, butternut squash, bell peppers, cherry tomatoes, kale, zucchini or mushroom--veggies that could be easily drizzled with olive oil and quickly sauteed or oven roasted.

I also cook and consume my food in order of perishability. If I have spinach, lettuce, arugula or Chinese greens, those are first to go. I'll save the cabbage and butternut squash for once the more perishable veggies are gone.

My average weekly haul is around $115 Australian, or about $75 American. That's probably already relatively lavish. I'm Asian so I can't live without intense flavours, so a significant portion of my groceries is spices, herbs and staple sauces.

I don't buy junk food--I limit my treats to a packet of shortbread, a bar of good chocolate, and sometimes potato chips or a trail mix. I don't buy frozen meals, but I might occasionally pick up a $12 ($8 American) rotisserie chicken to save time. I don't drink coffee but I do stock up on tea and long life milk.

My meal prep routine didn't just happen, I spent many years learning what works and what doesn't. My tastes also evolve as I learn new recipes and cooking techniques, or move to different parts of the world where ingrediente are different. Inevitably I've wasted some food in the process, which I feel bad about. But I live and learn and continue to do better.

These days I fill up my fridge on grocery day, consume what I have systematically, and at the end of a fortnight or so I'd have a satisfyingly empty fridge knowing that I've eaten everything and enjoyed some delightful meals.

The downside to my lifestyle is that it is time and energy consuming. It's not exactly convenient. Last saturday I spent a whole day making barbecue chicken from scratch.

But for me cooking is creative work and it's a great way to entertain myself. And I am a seaaoned cook so I eat like I have my own personal chef. It does mean I work for myself pro bono, but I do get rewarded with great meals. I brought my chicken to work today--not for sharing but I could tell my colleagues were jealous.

I'm planning to bring fried noodles to work on my birthday and invite my colleagues to eat together. I don't have money to treat them to a restaurant meal but I am a good cook and for a fraction of the cost I can feed close to ten people that I'm spending my work life with.

Personally, I find food prepping so central to my well being, and my physical and financial health. I've made it a priority in my adult life and it's been one of the best decisions I've ever made.

I understand that what I do isn't feasible for everybody. A friend of mine is a busy baby mum who is more time strapped than I am. She swears by a meal prep subscription that delivers her a daily box of ready to cook ingredients for a paint-by-numbers cooking experience. She said she hasn't wasted any food because the portions are just right.

Finally I'd add that any major changes in your life are only sustainable through community support. Please identify people in your offline life that would listen to you without judgment and have helpful wisdom for you to learn from.

I hope you're on your way to better health. Be well. || [removed] || Sorry to hear about how severe your anxiety can get, but you really need to kick your gaming habit.

Family members are so wasteful,"I've been spending more time at home recently and I'm becoming increasingly frustrated at how wasteful my parents are. They have previously been pretty good with recycling but have now stopped and claim 'it all goes to the same place'. They also seem to be a lot less conscious about single use plastic and leaving lights on, water running etc.

I'm pretty keen to try and steer them back towards being responsible but they are pretty stubborn people and do not like being told what to do - does anyone have any suggestions on small habits to try and get them to engage in that will hopefully snowball into a less wasteful mindset? Anyone else had the same experience?","Don't preach to influence others, it very much will have the opposite effect. Just do what you do. Be it only using your water bottle, you sorting the recycling. If you do things well, they will follow. You're right people don't like being told what to do, so lead by example || I'm at the opposite end of this. Mom uses pasta water to water plants and reuses yogurt lid foil. Good and fine A+ gold star. She refuses to believe some things aren't recyclable. We have six organized bins we compost, take to office Depot and Publix. She still digs through the trash for things that need to stay garbage.

I keep a grocery bag in my car to dispose of questionable items. The kitchen trash is barely full after a month. Doing pretty good. || >¬† 'it all goes to the same place'.¬†


They get their news from a specific source that ignores nuance; and more importantly,¬† doesn't want to adopt lifestyle changes.


I'd take them to recycle metal, when a commercial entity pays per pound and is busy all day, it makes it much clearer how important recycling is, and how much it is performed.¬†


But to take their side on a few things...


Leaving the lights on is inconsequential with modern LEDs that use <10% of the electricity of an incandescent. And lights increase utility, safety, and decrease vision loss and falls. If anything encourage them to install motion sensors where it makes sense.¬†


Single use plastics, especially film, have abysmal recycling rates, in part because of high contamination; other than a small non virgin market, the most likely outcome is incinerating it for energy in the future (which is a low likelihood today) || Lead by example and not by scolding. || I would look up the website for their county and see if there is actually a recycling program. || You can‚Äôt control them. You will make things worse in every way if you try. Focus on what you can do and try to accept that other people are not your department 
I struggle with this every day. Yesterday I heard someone in another bathroom stall use so much toilet paper they clogged the toilet. So stupid! One time I said something when I heard that galling sound ‚Äúroll roll roll roll tear‚Äù over and over and over and the guy threatened to fight me over the unwanted advice || I wouldn't bother.

Family dynamics are stronger than logic or facts.

Instead, get with some group of supportive people to share ideas with.

Then, perhaps someone ‚Äî or multiple people ‚Äî from your group could talk to your parents. || When people are set in their ways, then all you can do is present a few small things as handy hints to save money and leave it at that. If the savings make an impact, perhaps it will start something in their minds. || My only thought is smart lights, but that's buying more stuff that almost certainly more than offsets the benefits from power savings.


If the lights being left on is affecting the sleep of anyone in the household, then smart lighting may be worthwhile for improving sleep.


Likewise if anyone is struggling to physically make the rounds at night to shut the lights off, then the ability to turn the lights off remotely may be worth it for convenience.


On the other hand dealing with an app or wireless switches instead of simple physical switches is its own set of problems, and it can be frustrating to troubleshoot lights. || Stop spending your time at their house. It‚Äôs their house and their rules. || I know that, I told my mom stop buying the ice cream in plastic boxes, but she doesn't. At least she's buying way less plastic bottles with soft drinks nowadays, almost none.

Most people are like this tho, unable to change a habit as soon as it formed by convience and societal acceptance. || Yeah can relate. I try to angle things as a social project (excuse to spend time together) or pitch it as a project that's as much their idea as possible and/or an opportunity they might be missing. Just anything to avoid playing on shame or righteousness.


It's important to fully live the life you preach so to speak. Like knowing what and how things are recycled. Tying this together if you can use the stuff for something meaningful you can really drive the point home. For example I gather small 250 ml containers(something we often buy), then I 3d print inserts creating a system for small components(screws, nuts etc). I ask my dad if he can help me and his opinion on stuff related to this. Whatever he says, at the end I have a useful system for my DIY stuff. Hard to argue with that.  He can't talk trash about a generation being spoiled. He might get FOMO from throwing stuff out willy nilly. He starts thinking about this stuff. He feels useful etc etc.

If this is too much work then know that just holding trash or taking it home or whatever speaks volumes. There is often little need to say much. In your situation though I'd guess that cynicism is the real culprit. Support and love your parents and maybe they will have more energy for altruism? || You‚Äôll never get through to some people. They either don‚Äôt care or see it as their ‚Äúright‚Äù to be like that.

My in laws are what I call *actively wasteful*. Every light in their home is on day and night, multiple fans going in empty rooms, a/c at 60F, heat at 80F, game consoles running all night without anyone using them, letting the sink run while they brush their teeth, letting the kitchen sink run for no reason at all‚Ä¶ || Well there not completely wrong most of what you think recycled actually isn‚Äôt || They're adults, they can do what they want?  If you don't have to live there, let them be. Not your lane. I mean, I get it, the minute someone does ""zero"" waste [not actually possible in the imperial core 100%], they want everyone around them to do it. When the biggest problem is the oligarchs in the U.S. they pollute more than the working class & there are way more of us than there are of them. || Don't help people who don't wanna be helped and are set in their ways. You need to let It go. Or you will cause yourself so much suffering and misery. || Find what‚Äôs important to them and use that angle to reduce their waste eg showing cost savings, showing time savings (of not having to deal with packaging), showing health benefits, etc. || Is it THEM that changed on recycling or did the recycling collection rules change?

Where I used to live, they eliminated curbside recycling pickup.  You have to take the recyclables to the dump yourself.  As a result, many stopped recycling. || They aren't wrong about consumer level recycling. 90% of it goes to the landfill and the 10% that does get recycled does not compensate for the extra truck being driven around.  Industrial level recycling is much more efficient.

Outside of that it is a really bad idea to try to nag parents into doing things.  Just work on being responsible for yourself. || Find out what happens to the separated trash in your area. If your parents are right that it all gets sent to the same landfill, that's one battle you don't need to fight.

Storage Method for Gifting Bread,Hi all! I make a decent amount of bread/bread products. For my own uses I generally store them in stasher bags or beeswax wrap. Where I am running into a challenge is when I give bread to other people. I am looking for suggestions as to what storage method I can use for bread that I won't regret giving away.

Sustainable toner pads for skincare? Different fabrics fraying?,"The soothing hydrating toner pads sound so calming and cooling for my irritated and flushed skin but they‚Äôre disposable and expensive. People just put one on the forehead and one on each cheek, letting the toner soak in while the thin wet pads cool down the skin. I thought it would be easy to find reusable toner pads I could use with my hydrating toner, but no luck.

All the reusable cotton pads look so thick they would absorb too much product and fall off the skin. The toner pads are usually very thin. Of course I could make them from some fabric, I've looked at thin microfiber face towels or muslin baby washcloths online, but I would have to sew the edges so they don‚Äôt fray. Is there any fabric that would be suitable for soaking in toner and keeping on the face that doesn‚Äôt require finishing?

ideas on how to use these?,non-recyclable plastic caps to something i unfortunately need to routinely buy for the time-being; snap pea for scale,"I think in cases like this it's worth considering responsibility in reuse. 

Presumably you could glue a bunch together and make some contraption or such but at this point you have reduced the initial item to its base unrecyclable state. Odds are anything you do with it will add recyclable items or make it otherwise harder to responsibly dispose of. 

Sometimes making sure something makes it's way into a landfill and not someplace else is the best option and I think it should be encouraged over hanging onto useless bits of plastic just because we don't want it to be waste. Unfortunately it is waste and it already exists. You already did all you could in so far as you can't reduce it and have already broken it down and removed anything that was recyclable /non waste. 

Guiding these items to a responsible final resting place is often times the best thing. || could make some cute stamps if you happen to have rubber or something laying around, lol. || Their is some cute videos online on how to make miniatures for doll houses out of caps and small items.

What are good non-cotton eco-friendly fabrics?,"Hello! I am someone with something called Sensory Processing disorder a disorder that can make you sensative to fabrics. I am SUPER sensitive to cotton and denim to the point where wearing them makes me feel like i am choking. Polyester is the main fabric i feel comfortable in and is the easiest to obtain for me. Is there any eco friendly fabrics that feel like polyester? 

Also just to preface, touching cotton is also very bad for me which is why i cannot go to thrift, thank you!!!","Hemp, linen(flax), bamboo, lyocel/Tencel(wood pulp). I didn't mention silk or wool because I figured you already know about it. || First of all, for people with health issues, one should not sacrifice their health for zero waste. If polyester is all you can wear, then so be it. With regard to thrift shopping, you might find a friend who could shop with you to find polyester, so you don't have to touch other fabric.  
  
You might try lyocell or modal fabrics (sometimes called Tencel). While not perfect environmentally, it is probably better than polyester. || If you can‚Äôt thrift in a shop you could also buy online on sites like Poshmark. Not a perfect option but could work || Ramie!
Lyocell/tencel
Wool
Linen
Silk

ETA: I agree with the other poster, if polyester is the only thing you can wear, you wearing it isn't going to make a huge difference in terms of the environment. Big clothing companies need to buck up and work on reducing their impact. We do what we can, but if you are going to buy a piece that's eco friendly and not wear it, that's also technically a waste. || From a zero waste perspective, you can make a positive contribution to the environment by buying durable or thrifted clothes and wearing them a lot. Much of the environmental impact of clothing is due to overconsumption and a disposable clothing approach. 

If you want to avoid generating microplastics, bamboo rayon (best green credentials is Tencel) is a solid option. || I am the same. I never wore denim but have been slowly building up my wardrobe with natural fibers because I don‚Äôt like synthetics either (eye roll) and not tolerating cotton is really annoying. Bamboo, lyocell, and tencel are alternatives that I have tried and ultimately decided against. If you can, lighter linen is very tolerable. I always get a size larger to avoid seams and get secondhand/wash a few times before wearing so the linen isn‚Äôt too stiff and itchy. Linen is a wonderful fabric and I‚Äôve found that it layers with wool very well. Sometimes fabrics don‚Äôt provide enough of a barrier between wool and skin, but linen has served me well in that regard. I‚Äôve also settled on cashmere for all of my woolen needs because, to me, it‚Äôs the best feeling. The downside is linen and cashmere are much more expensive than cotton, so quality options are limited. I buy secondhand, which I acknowledge can be an issue to some. 

One last thing: if you have clothes that you own and love that aren‚Äôt made of the best materials, don‚Äôt jump to replace them with natural fibers. Wear what you have when you can and when you absolutely can‚Äôt go without make the decision that suits you best. Don‚Äôt try to force things to work or try different brands of a fabric that you know you don‚Äôt like. That just leads to more waste in the end. || lyocell/modal/tencel (this can be somewhat variable but I love the kind that Eileen Fisher uses) I think has the smoothest texture that would remind me of polyester fabrics. 

You should also check out superfine merino and linen clothes. Especially when linen is broken in it can be really nice and soft. Also, pima cotton or Egyptian cotton, or some cotton blends can be very smooth and soft. || Would you be able to thrift wearing gloves to avoid touching the fabrics? You could possibly design some general non-textual tests to help define what is/is not suitable based on what you currently wear? || I like merino wool. Not itchy like other wools and super durable || Pima cotton or combed cotton feel most like polyester. Outside of cotton, I would say rayon feels closest to polyester but it‚Äôs arguably eco friendly. || A lot of people offered good suggestions so I won't repeat, but I'm pondering the sensory issues interfering with thrifting. If it's something you wanna do could you take something with you that could keep you from having to touch clothes? Gloves are kind of a sensory nightmare so I was imagining some sort of stick-shaped keychain that you could use to look through clothing racks. || Buying used is always more eco friendly. Doesn't matter what type. Using what already exists uses less resources than creating new. || Some polyester fabrics are made from recycled plastic. I haven't looked into the eco credentials of it though. || I recommend modal. It can be incredibly soft. || If it is durable / you‚Äôre not buying a new thing all the time then that is the sustainable option. So, buy good quality polyester as opposed to one that wears out quickly. Check out some of Patagonia apparel. || I totally understand I have sensory processing disorder/ issues too. 

I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wool if your like me and can‚Äôt do rough fabrics. 

I would wear fabrics you can tolerate and just get it second hand instead of new. With any medical condition you put your needs first before being eco friendly. 

My fav brand is old navy not eco friendly but I do make it more eco friendly by buying that brand second hand. So if you have brands you know you love then write them down then buy second hand versions of them. You can second hand shop online so your able to avoid touching cotton || I‚Äôve got SPD too so I get it. I know you said you cannot thrift, but what about thrifting fabrics you can wear. It will still be eco friendly as you are refusing something that would have been thrown out otherwise. || Many of the fabrics mentioned already are subtypes of rayon, including viscose, modal, and lyocell (which can go by several brand names, including Tencel and Seacell). When you see a fabric just labeled as ‚Äúbamboo‚Äù it is also a type of rayon. Rayons are plastic-free, biodegradable, and likely offer the closest feeling to polyester! The production methods for each type of rayon can vary in how sustainable they are for the environment. The traditional rayon process uses harsh chemicals that can be pretty awful on the environment during the manufacturing process, but more advanced processes like the lyocell process use a closed-loop system for the chemicals so the environmental effects are significantly lessened! 

As someone who is also sensitive to fabric textures (velvet is my nemesis) I‚Äôd also highly recommend silk! || I‚Äôm going to try bamboo because I get so hot at night. I also considered linen, but wondered if it would look like a wrinkled massacre even after I made the bed. || Bamboo viscose feels very similar to some polyester fabrics! And it tends to be cheaper than modal/tencel. I find it to be more breathable than polyester, too.",33,ZeroWaste,2025-06-08 03:39:17,good non cotton eco friendly fabrics,hello someone something called sensory processing disorder disorder make sensative fabrics super sensitive cotton denim point wearing makes feel like choking polyester main fabric feel comfortable easiest obtain eco friendly fabrics feel like polyester also preface touching cotton also bad cannot go thrift thank,hemp linen flax bamboo lyocel tencel wood pulp mention silk wool figured already know first people health issues one sacrifice health zero waste polyester wear regard thrift shopping might find friend could shop find polyester touch fabric might try lyocell modal fabrics sometimes called tencel perfect environmentally probably better polyester thrift shop could also buy online sites like poshmark perfect option could work ramie lyocell tencel wool linen silk eta agree poster polyester thing wear wearing going make huge difference terms environment big clothing companies need buck work reducing impact going buy piece eco friendly wear also technically waste zero waste perspective make positive contribution environment buying durable thrifted clothes wearing lot much environmental impact clothing due overconsumption disposable clothing approach want avoid generating microplastics bamboo rayon best green credentials tencel solid option never wore denim slowly building wardrobe natural fibers like synthetics either eye roll tolerating cotton really annoying bamboo lyocell tencel alternatives tried ultimately decided lighter linen tolerable always get size larger avoid seams get secondhand wash times wearing linen stiff itchy linen wonderful fabric found layers wool well sometimes fabrics provide enough barrier wool skin linen served well regard also settled cashmere woolen needs best feeling downside linen cashmere much expensive cotton quality options limited buy secondhand acknowledge issue one last thing clothes love made best materials jump replace natural fibers wear absolutely go without make decision suits best try force things work try different brands fabric know like leads waste end lyocell modal tencel somewhat variable love kind eileen fisher uses think smoothest texture would remind polyester fabrics also check superfine merino linen clothes especially linen broken really nice soft also pima cotton egyptian cotton cotton blends smooth soft would able thrift wearing gloves avoid touching fabrics could possibly design general non textual tests help define suitable based currently wear like merino wool itchy like wools super durable pima cotton combed cotton feel like polyester outside cotton would say rayon feels closest polyester arguably eco friendly lot people offered good suggestions repeat pondering sensory issues interfering thrifting something wanna could take something could keep touch clothes gloves kind sensory nightmare imagining sort stick shaped keychain could use look clothing racks buying used always eco friendly matter type using already exists uses less resources creating new polyester fabrics made recycled plastic looked eco credentials though recommend modal incredibly soft durable buying new thing time sustainable option buy good quality polyester opposed one wears quickly check patagonia apparel totally understand sensory processing disorder issues recommend wool like rough fabrics would wear fabrics tolerate get second hand instead new medical condition put needs first eco friendly fav brand old navy eco friendly make eco friendly buying brand second hand brands know love write buy second hand versions second hand shop online able avoid touching cotton got spd get know said cannot thrift thrifting fabrics wear still eco friendly refusing something would thrown otherwise many fabrics mentioned already subtypes rayon including viscose modal lyocell go several brand names including tencel seacell see fabric labeled bamboo also type rayon rayons plastic free biodegradable likely offer closest feeling polyester production methods type rayon vary sustainable environment traditional rayon process uses harsh chemicals pretty awful environment manufacturing process advanced processes like lyocell process use closed loop system chemicals environmental effects significantly lessened someone also sensitive fabric textures velvet nemesis also highly recommend silk going try bamboo get hot night also considered linen wondered would look like wrinkled massacre even made bed bamboo viscose feels similar polyester fabrics tends cheaper modal tencel find breathable polyester
Looking for bar shampoo/conditioner. Brands?,"I'm not new to the zero waste lifestyle but I've been settling in slowly and carefully. My current project is moving away from plastic shampoo/conditioner bottles, and a coworker recommended bar soaps. What are some good brands to start with?","My favorite shampoo so far has been Superzero! My favorite conditioner has been Dip. I have also used Ethique (which I like) and Hibar (I think?)

I‚Äôve gotten Ethique from Ulta, but otherwise I‚Äôve gotten bar shampoo/conditioner from a local refill store or directly from the brand‚Äôs website.

I switched to bar soap last year, and not only does it save on plastic waste, I find I don't get super stinky by the end of the day anymore, so I don't feel the need for another shower. I just don't think shower gel is a good fit for me. 

Composting! All fresh scraps go in there, all solarised garden weeds, and any failed plants go in there too. The resulting compost goes back into my vegetable garden. 
My dog eats the other leftovers. He's an ex street dog, so if I don't give him them, he *will* kick the bin over. || Maybe a TMI one, but a menstrual disc. Makes the week so much more manageable and I never need to buy pads or tampons so saving money too. 


I‚Äôm also a big fan of concentrates for cleaning products like from Grove. It‚Äôs so much more ~*~ aesthetic ~*~ but also I have a ton of extra room under my sink and I can recycle or reuse the little glass bottles. || Thrifting for clothes

- not buying new clothes. Had a challenge in 2019 of not buying new. Bought one new dress. Haven‚Äôt bought anything brand new since apart from a waterproof raincoat. If I really want something new, I ask for it for a birthday or Christmas gift. This year I‚Äôm asking for new compression socks for work off a relative as my birthday gift. Couldn‚Äôt imagine spending the money to buy new now

- not buying plastic bags for freezing, camping, and storage needs. Why when I can reuse bead and cereal packaging? || Trying to switch up too many things at once is unsustainable for most people.

I just keep adding as I go along, it‚Äôs actually so much healthier too with what we are learning about micro plastics and pfas. || Towels instead of paper towels (except for bodily fluids, I have pets). I do not buy coffee or any drinks out except for special occasions, I always bring my own to work in a reusable thermos, same with travelling with my own water bottle everywhere. Beeswax wraps and silicone lids instead of cling wrap, solid dish wash, powder laundry detergent in bulk, silicone bags instead of disposable ziplocks and using random saved glass jars instead of buying new plastic Tupperware.

I‚Äôve also used stainless steel or glass straws now for over a decade and have never missed the plastic crap. I travel with my own cutlery because plastic cutlery that snaps when you spear a steak makes me actually angry lmao. I also have reusable pee pads for my senior dog instead of using disposables. And here in my province plastic bags are banned, but even before that I had been using either a rolling shopping cart or sturdy reusable bags because I don‚Äôt like my fingers getting lack of circulation from plastic bags lmao. I also use reusable bags for putting my grocery loose things in, rather than the plastic single use ones. If I do use a plastic bag, I reuse it again as garbage bags. 

One thing I cannot do but wish I could is bar soap. I have highly reactive eczema prone skin. I tried bar soap for years but I could not find a single one that didn‚Äôt screw up my skin - because the truth is I do not think I can use typical ‚Äúsoap‚Äù.

More and more studies are showing that virtually every kind of plastic leeches out chemicals and sheds micro particles under all kinds of situations.

Textile Recycling,"This might just be venting but I‚Äôm open to feedback and other options. 

My mom had 3 boxes of clothes that she was going to throw away because they are well beyond their useful life. I‚Äôve seen a lot of recommendations to use them as rags, make blankets, etc. The issue is that I have decluttered my home and don‚Äôt want to add more. Let‚Äôs be honest. There‚Äôs only so many rags a person needs. I don‚Äôt live in an area that does much to support the community and offer options, and most of the people where I live are not environmentally conscious and would not take it (even on the buy nothing subs). 

A lot of people recommend taking it to goodwill or other thrift stores for textile recycling, but from what I‚Äôve researched, none of the textile recycling is legitimate. Trashie, For Days, Goodwill, etc all sell/send the textiles to other countries.

I feel truly overwhelmed by the feeling of trying to find another solution, but I‚Äôve had these boxes of clothes in my car for months because I feel overwhelmed by the guilt of throwing them away because I wanted to find a home for them. 

How do you deal with not being able to do the sustainable option sometimes? I‚Äôm worried I will become a hoarder by taking on things other people don‚Äôt want to make sure it‚Äôs not thrown away, or I will drive far away to get something recycling and the emissions will outweigh the benefit. 

","I've often seen this suggestion here : offer them to an animal shelter. Might be worth a try. || I completely second the feeling of being a hoarder to avoid waste. Sometimes I have no clue what do to.

If you know how to sew, you could make some new things out of it. Maybe some storage bags, market bags, etc. You don‚Äôt need to keep them, you could hand them out.

For donating, you could also call up any local churches, homeless shelters, etc. My community has centers for single mothers, and other stuff like that so i would research and look to donate to them. || You can‚Äôt make clothes sustainable after the fact. 

If you own enough rags, and you don‚Äôt feel like making a craft, then that‚Äôs it. The least harmful thing at this point is to throw them in landfill trash, unless you have access to a textile recycling program that really turns them into insulation or something. || I totally get how overwhelming that can feel. I had a similar experience after cleaning out my aunt‚Äôs place so many clothes and no clear solution that felt both responsible and easy. I came across a service called Remoovit that helps people donate, recycle, or resell things like clothes, furniture, and more. They even pick things up. Might be worth checking out if you're just feeling stuck and want it handled in a sustainable way without more stress. || Also you might want to try your local FB. A lot of people upcycle or repurpose textiles. || Google where to recycle textiles in your area. Is the place close? Easy to get to? No? Then you throw them out. || So, I‚Äôve gotten stuck here for years. I held on to way too much in hopes to find a good way to recycle it. I never did and it was impacting my sanity and my home. I eventually bought Trashie bags. I know they are not ideal, but I figured that if ANY of it was useful and got turned into something or could be reused than it‚Äôs better than sitting in my garage or closet or throwing it away. I still don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the best answer, but it‚Äôs been the only way I‚Äôve been able to reconcile this problem and move forward. || You could sort out 100% natural fiber clothing and try to send to a commercial compost facility? || Sometimes schools or community organizations have uses for them, especially if they have sewing or theater programs. If they are really all beyond being able to be used for projects, maybe a local animal shelter would be interested. Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. As the daughter of a hoarder, trust me, it‚Äôs better for you to just throw things away sometimes. If you are able to determine if any of the clothing is made from 100% natural fibers you may be able to compost that rather than tossing it. || Give yourself permission to landfill things if that is less wasteful. Remember time is a precious resource, if you spend hours figuring out what to do with something of low value that is wasting your time.

Many times in our effort to prevent waste we recklessly spend time, burn gas driving around, waste fuel by hauling heavy items around while we dither, etc. 

The reality is that in our world there is a river of textiles flowing through our communities. It is far in excess of what anyone needs. The bags of cloth you have are of very little value, if they go to the landfill you can easily obtain many more if you ever decide you need them for free.

My opinion, and I say this as someone who reuses rags until they are hopelessly worn out and filthy, is to let it go. It is not worth making a special trip, it is not worth expending resources to ship them somewhere, it is not worth time to try to find someone who can use them. I have accepted that I will throw away some things that still have use because there is not enough value in them to justify the effort.

I'll continue to wear my shoes until they fall apart, save the laces for some reason, extract the insoles for reuse, and STILL feel guilty for landfilling the wreckage. || I‚Äôve been using trashie to save my sanity. It is helping me and I feel I did a little tiny bit more than simply landfill. || My county supposedly has actual textile recycling. You could also make a rug with it. But i know that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre asking about. I feel you. What helps me throw things away when i know i need to is to remember how wasteful people are and how much waste is happening right now. It‚Äôs sad, but it helps me. || Glitch Detected

Cleaning clothes with washboards,"I am considering switching to doing laundry with a washboard. It will save money and decrease water usage, and our ancestors used it for so long that I know it is an effective cleaning method. Was curious if anyone had any they recommend and tips/tricks you can share. Thanks! ","I tried this for a while. It is so much work and takes way longer. If you don‚Äôt ring them out perfectly (which seems to be impossible for some thicker fabrics) they smell while drying. I went back to washing with cold water and laundry soap in a plastic free container and hanging to dry. My advice is don‚Äôt waste your time and save your sanity. || Laundry used to be very time consuming, difficult work. It would take a full day during a time where people were wearing less clothes. || I am unconvinced this saves anything outside of electrical use, and it's likely minimal compared to everything else. I feel like wasting your time doesn't get enough attention. Just do fewer loads in the washer and switch to line drying. || I would just hand-wash delicate items like a silk shirt, etc. Back in the olden days ordinary folk did not wash clothes that frequently. If wealthy or even solid middle-class they had servants to do it or sent it out. As Betty-Rose said, it's an ordeal & physically tasking. || Just be careful. I know someone who severely and permanently injured themselves from the repetitive motion. If it hurts, stop. || You would be better off using the reclaimed two 5 gallon bucket and plunger method. There are multiple tutorials on YouTube. 

I did laundry for a family of 4 with preK kids for a couple of months & it was definitely a workout. It helped that it was in the summer and I could line dry. || do you know how much water it saves? I‚Äôve heard that dishwashers are more water efficient than hand washing dishes and not sure if the same is true for clothes. I‚Äôm all for hang drying things out of the washer- even sheets, blankets, jeans, and I‚Äôve never had a smell issue. || I have no advice but I want to comment because it is interesting to me what zero waste is to different people. I am currently researching/comparing steam closet cleaners in order to wash clothes less. I think it will help my household be more sustainable by saving on water and electricity from the dryer, buying less laundry detergent products, and maintaining the clothes in a good condition for longer. I currently have to wash my clothing and linens very often due to my allergies and asthma. || It‚Äôs REALLY hard on your clothes. Modern washers (especially front-loaders) are very water- and energy-efficient. || Washboards are for stubborn stains. There were agitator looking things (if you do an image search for laundry plunger you'll see these wooden things with what look to be four feet, that's what I'm talking about) which you used with a tub full of water and soap for the general cleaning, which turned into agitator washing machines where the robot did the moving but the overall way of cleaning didn't change at all.

*IF* you used a washboard, it was to give an extra hard scrub to particularly soiled and stained areas. It was not for general laundry use. We've replaced washboards with stain sprays and stain sticks and other pretreatments.

So, that in mind, if you want to go back to the old way of doing laundry, check out Lehmans catalogue for both their laundry plunger and their rocking washbasin dealie. Both of those will be more effective for generally dirty clothes than a washboard will.

You can pick up a palm sized washboard for any stain scrubbing you might think to do if you don't pretreat with literally any other more modern pretreatment formulation at all. When I travel and do sink laundry, I use the soap of the accommodation, and so I bring a palm sized washboard with me for stains. || Do you have time and patience for it. There a reason they stopped doing it cause it takes a lot of patience and time. || I live off grid and do laundry in two utility sinks ($80ea), a caliber wringer, wooden washboard, plunger for agitation and greenhouse clothesline as a dryer.

 For soap I go 1-1-1 castile bar, washing soda, and borax with a little tea tree and lemon grass oil. It works amazing! My clothes are so much cleaner and they don't feel like they are coated in ""and more"" ingredients. 

This set up works for my family six. My daughter and I both use trad cloth diapers for moon cycles. My man does lawn work and comes in covered in ferns and gasoline and grease. || You could use other methods that your great-grandparents were familiar with that reduce washing and are good for your clothes. Before washing machines were invented, people had a lot of reliable techniques to clean clothes and make them hygienic again without a time-consuming laundry day.

Ironing was popular to kill bacteria and remove smells without washing delicate fabrics such as wool or silk. 

You brush out your clothes with a clothes brush to remove dust. Then, you check for stains and treat them locally with a sponge. Then you iron your clothes, or, in our modern times, use a steam cleaner. The heat will kill bacteria and smells. You can also sprinkle some scented water on the clothes before ironing.

Also, during my childhood, every home had a clothes hook outside the window where you could secure 3-4 clothes hangers. Airing clothes overnight was an accepted way to make them smell fresh again.

Clothes made of natural fibres aren't meant to be washed after each use. Shake them out, treat stains locally, and iron them. Air them. Only wash as needed.

Winter is a great opportunity to hang out clothes overnight for a deep refresh. The cold freezes superficial moisture on the fibres, making your wool pullover soft and fluffy again. Freezing water extends and by extending, it unfurls natural fibres. The jeans company Levi's recommends putting your jeans in the freezer for a quick refresh instead of in the washer, and only wash them if they have visible stains.

Air, iron, brush out, steam, or freeze your clothes. Don't wash them every time you wear them. No one did this before washing machines, polyester, and fast fashion were invented. || Skipping the dryer is the biggest win in laundry. I also wash less often, wear clothes a few times before washing. But I haven't tried a washboard. || I have had to do this out of necessity and it would take me all day, and that day didn't end with dry laundry. It was full-time job that I would advise against. You can use a lot of water doing it by hand, it might surprise you. I would use cold water and try one of the new detergent sheets first. Good luck. || You should try to hunt down an antique roller wringer or a modern version of this.  

I had my washing machine break and I washed clothes in the bathtub by hand.  Wringing the clothes out was the hardest part.  If you think you have wrung them out enough, you squeeze again, and a ton more water comes out.

I wouldn't do it again unless I had to.  It is a time consuming thing. || I think this is commendable but we‚Äôve come a long way, and there‚Äôs a reason.  Progress is nothing to be ashamed of.  Yes, we‚Äôre dealing with carbon footprints, but your washing machine is not moving the needle.  I promise.  And this is coming from a serious green hippie.

Sustainable craft kits,"Sorry if this isn‚Äôt the best sub. 

Hello, Im 17 and an a junior in hs. I am in the process of starting a club that creates craft kits for children in hospitals. I need sustainable packaging ideas that aren‚Äôt super expensive. My first idea was just boxes but I know they would get tossed, same goes for plastic packaging. I appreciate all suggestions!!","What all is in the kits? My first thought is paper bags if the contents are not terribly heavy or fragile. Yes, they‚Äôll get tossed but it‚Äôs better than plastic. 

Or if the kit is building or making something, could you make a box part of the something? Like building doll furniture and having the box decorated like a doll house. Making friendship bracelets and having the box look like a jewelry box. 

Really depends on what the kits are. || Zip Lock plastic bags with a pretty design printed on them, so they are more likely to be reused? It‚Äôs also handy to store the supplies inside, if the kid doesn‚Äôt finish the kit in a single session. Usually not my first choice but were dealing with a) kids, and b) in special circumstances.

If possible use already recycled materials over materials that are recyclable.

Recycled (Brown) paper bags or envelopes or boxes with a stamped/printed/painted/ sticker from your club. Direct recycling could be cool: old maps are great, maybe pretty old textbook pages, or posters for events that already took place. There is plenty of paper in a school see if you can use some.

Something to consider: Try making your kit look very different from the medical supplies the kids are surrounded by their whole hospital stay. And possibly have painful and bad experiences attached to. Make it look fun! Make the design enticing to do the kit. Ask for feedback on your first tests. || Could your school collect cereal boxes or now that everyone orders everything online, smaller shipping boxes? || They make compostable ziploc bags that aren‚Äôt too expensive. You could also reuse plastic bags from the grocery store, have a basket to collect them from people. || Cheap fishing tackle boxes are great for a bunch of craft stuff. || What about a 2 pocket folder?  If the contents are flat.
If they‚Äôre more bulky, I like the idea of a kraft bag with handles.  You or the recipient could decorate/personalize it too. || If the crafts are small you could fold old assignment papers into envelopes and tie them shut with string. The school might bulk order supplies in bubble mailers or boxes you can snatch up too",10,ZeroWaste,2025-06-04 07:56:42,sustainable craft kits,sorry best sub hello im junior hs process starting club creates craft kits children hospitals need sustainable packaging ideas super expensive first idea boxes know would get tossed goes plastic packaging appreciate suggestions,kits first thought paper bags contents terribly heavy fragile yes get tossed better plastic kit building making something could make box part something like building doll furniture box decorated like doll house making friendship bracelets box look like jewelry box really depends kits zip lock plastic bags pretty design printed likely reused also handy store supplies inside kid finish kit single session usually first choice dealing kids b special circumstances possible use already recycled materials materials recyclable recycled brown paper bags envelopes boxes stamped printed painted sticker club direct recycling could cool old maps great maybe pretty old textbook pages posters events already took place plenty paper school see use something consider try making kit look different medical supplies kids surrounded whole hospital stay possibly painful bad experiences attached make look fun make design enticing kit ask feedback first tests could school collect cereal boxes everyone orders everything online smaller shipping boxes make compostable ziploc bags expensive could also reuse plastic bags grocery store basket collect people cheap fishing tackle boxes great bunch craft stuff pocket folder contents flat bulky like idea kraft bag handles recipient could decorate personalize crafts small could fold old assignment papers envelopes tie shut string school might bulk order supplies bubble mailers boxes snatch
What/who is this sub even for?,"I was hoping to learn some new tips and hacks like upcycling and recycling, but instead most of the posts are just unhinged questions like ‚Äúis it ethical to use water to flush my poop down the toilet?‚Äù

Sorry to be rude, I feel like we‚Äôre all coming from a good place, but what is the point of these kinds of posts? ","People in this sub get so hung up on the super fine details of everything, and then they come out with unhinged questions like this, or asking if they can still keep using the cleaning products they already have in their home until they're used up. The ridiculous cycle of people freaking out over the small things makes the movement as a whole seem inaccessible. They seem to miss the point that we do not need a small group of people doing zero waste perfectly, but rather a much wider audience doing it in the most accessible imperfect way. || Search the sub history for things you‚Äôre interested in. I‚Äôve found a lot of great tips that way. If you‚Äôre just on the front page, it‚Äôs almost always gonna be a mixed bag || I have OCD, and before I knew I had OCD my fixation on wastefulness and sustainability had a huge grip on me. It felt like a huge moral failing to waste, and it felt like I *had* to be as efficient in waste reduction as I could. I would fall to pieces if I realized I could have done more. And the goalpost would always move, and the pressure to do better got heavier and heavier. 

Learning that I had OCD and learning some non traditional ways OCD can manifest really opened my eyes. 

Reducing waste is a good thing, but perfection is unattainable and frequently a hidden snare that only gets tighter as you persist. 

There are some people here who are painfully relatable to me. It‚Äôs not my place to diagnose them or tell them they‚Äôre chasing an unattainable goal. Even if it was my place, most people with obsessive compulsive tendencies are not ready or willing to hear that their ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù concerns may also be a mental health concern. Reducing waste is absolutely something we should all strive for, but if you‚Äôre so pressed about whether or not it‚Äôs okay to flush a toilet, it may be time to look inward and ask yourself if you‚Äôre doing the right thing because you want to help or if you‚Äôre doing it to avoid the emotional fallout. || Hey, once I saw a post in a vegan sub about whether or not it's ethical to kill head lice on someone's own child. It was serious. So at least we don't have that, right? || No! This sub is perfection.

It is a lot of genuinely helpful suggestions interspersed with  ‚ÄúLook at this perfectly good mattress by the dumpster! Why would anyone throw this out?‚Äù with a thousand upvotes.

Why you gotta come in here and mess up this perfectly healthy and delightful balance?

Every post I read here I‚Äôm like ‚Äúis it zero waste or is it a crippling mental illness?‚Äù || Lolll OP I feel you

I haven't been in here too long and I'm still debating if I want to stay - because half of the posts are unhinged. For instance asking how to reuse one plastic item that's clearly in tatters, or asking to swap second hand period products

There's a line between *healthy* and *zerowaste* alot of people here don't seem to consider. Destroying your wellbeing, or even putting it at risk to be frugal or not waste is unfathomable to me

You have nothing without health, that should always come before a choice (as many here are zerowaste because they make a choice to make a difference, not because they're destitute and have no other resources) || my favorites are the ones who post their new ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù product and then delete the post after they‚Äôve been bullied || Hang around for a bit.  What you came for is what I came for and it's mostly what I've found.

Apparently, you are only good enough if u embrace the lifestyle of naked and afraid. || What's the answer though, ethical or not? || I find r/anticonsumption to be more keen on practical tips || Are you new to the internet? Just ignore the crazies || I lurk because I have strong urges to hoard things (which I'm mostly successful at controlling), and both zero waste and anticonsumption are fun, interesting hobbies that do NOT require the purchase and fight-not-to-hoard of supplies. || My primary guides to zero waste are the Open University Carbon Calculator,

[https://students.open.ac.uk/candc/carbon\_calculator/](https://students.open.ac.uk/candc/carbon_calculator/)

my bank balance and the ongoing disposable income calculation in my household accounts.

Ethics are good but buying to last, planning for the future, being frugal, mending and making do are just good housekeeping.

There‚Äôs never a need to make a cult out of it. || This sub is for folks like me who worry about things like scrubbers for dishes that are made ethically and leave no trace.  We do leave a trace, how can we minimize it? That -to me- is this sub. || I considered unfollowing within a week of joining the sub, it was so wild. ü§£ But it evened out a bit and eventually some legitimately interesting posts popped up, so I stuck around.

Any tricks to remove polarization from sunglass lenses?,"I have these sunglasses and I love them. The polarization has rubbed off in a few spots and it's interfering with my vision. Any tricks to remove the rest of the polarization? The plastic under the lenses isn't scratched.

https://preview.redd.it/x1rtwx9t1j4f1.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=907d4223c236b5c584de9863430ed02deb707140

","1. That‚Äôs not the polarization, it‚Äôs the mirror finish. 

2. You can remove it with some scrubbing, but I don‚Äôt remember the specifics of what to use. Hopefully someone else can help. || If it cannot be peeled off in one go then any method to remove it will be too abrasive (manual or chemical) and will damage the lenses. They are at the end of their natural lifecycle. Dispose of properly and adjust consumption going forward (perhaps a biodegradable frame or a metal frame that can have the lenses switched out to reduce waste). || I removed the scratched mirror finish on a pair of Goodrs with toothpaste and a flannel cloth with decent success. I can't say I didn't scratch them or not. If I did, it wasn't enough to annoy me. But I didn't wear them for long as I came across another unscratched, non-mirrored pair at a yard sale that fit me perfectly for $0.50 right when I did it. 

I say, if they are already messed up enough to be anoying... Try it! You can't repair them back to a non-scratched mirror finish, so go for it!

Oh, and I will now only buy non-mirrored for this exact reason lol || So I‚Äôm currently removing some polarization from a pair of sunglasses a friend gave me I used nail polish remover on a qtip and my finger to massage it in something about the heat of your finger and the chemical helps break it down

Waste,"I live in a community where every year, we get a large dumpster to dump large items into. I don‚Äôt understand this. We never use it and every year our community fills it up. Last year they had to get two. How is this an ok thing? I tried questioning it and i can‚Äôt even remember what they said. It‚Äôs just a ‚Äúnice‚Äù thing they do for the members for some reason. Maybe to help the community stay nice and discourage people from accumulating waste? Does anyone have experience with this? ","My town does an annual junk weekend. You bring any household junk and they dispose of it. Our taxes cover it. They actually make money on it because of all the scrap metal people have laying around to bring in.

The idea is to get people to clean up their properties and then the town doesn't have to deal with them. 

People generally are getting rid of old furniture, metal, bulky things. 

I'm not saying I'm for or against it but that's what they do. || Large items are a PitA to get rid of. Like it or not, furniture doesn't last like it used to. Eventually you have to get rid of bulk items, and with enough people you can easily fill up a dumpster. I always encourage people to buy less items, buy higher quality less often, but there needs to be a way to deal with that IKEA crap everyone already owns. 

Also because everything is crappy, people don't swap stuff secondhand like they used to. My sofa is barely hangin on after 12 years now, I don't know if I could give it away for free. And also there's a legitimate fear of bedbugs when going secondhand, they're harder to get rid of than back when we used the gnarliest pesticides known to man. || I am going to play devils advocate here: I don't think these dumpsters encourage people accumulating waste. I don't think the absence of them would discourage this. I can think of some negative things that can come from people not having these opportunities (some of these are far fetched, I know):

\- Large items such as chairs and couches get left on the side of the road. Critters and pests make homes in them (not great). Someone else may pick these up to bring into their own house after a few days/weeks and now they have unwanted pests that may require chemicals and get rid of them

\- people put large (non recyclable) items in the recycling bin (Where I grew up, our recycling bins were bigger than trash bins (city supplied). I DID see people use recycling bins as overflow trash bins, especially for large items

\- extra trash ends up on the street and never gets picked up || Unfortunately a lot of those are items that will commonly get dumped off the side of a rural road to avoid having to pay to dispose of them. Harm reduction in a way(can't think of the correct word here). || My city waste offers three bulk waste pickups per year; you call and schedule them. The waste company says they try to reuse stuff as appropriate vs going straight to the dump, but there‚Äôs no way to know tbh.¬†

My previous city did one bulk trash pickup per year instead (a few streets per week), and there were always a few pickup trucks cruising the streets before the collection trucks came and they would grab things they thought could be reused or resold (so in that sense, pretty good reuse likelihood too).¬† || Most people in my area use large dumpsters to toss things like soiled mattresses, and construction waste. That's not getting upcycled.

The last bulky things I tossed were two very broken, not salvageable, not recyclable shower doors. Remember- ""repair"" is one of the Rs so there will always be things that need to be tossed. House parts just happen to be rather large, so there is waste when it's repaired. It's just less waste overall to repair - and that's still a good thing. For example, my shower doors were literally ancient and much past their usable lifespan and not something I originally installed.

If you want to make your event more ""zero"" waste, ask the organizers if they'd be willing to include a blurb advertising buy nothing groups on their dumpster advertisments to get rid of the somewhat usable/upcycable items first prior to dumpster day. Phrase it as more of ""I know the dumpster always fills up, and promoting buy nothing groups might be a good way to get more room for the dumpser without increasing costs to rent more"".",8,ZeroWaste,2025-06-01 23:16:11,waste,live community every year get large dumpster dump large items understand never use every year community fills last year get two ok thing tried questioning even remember said nice thing members reason maybe help community stay nice discourage people accumulating waste anyone experience,town annual junk weekend bring household junk dispose taxes cover actually make money scrap metal people laying around bring idea get people clean properties town deal people generally getting rid old furniture metal bulky things saying large items pita get rid like furniture last like used eventually get rid bulk items enough people easily fill dumpster always encourage people buy less items buy higher quality less often needs way deal ikea crap everyone already owns also everything crappy people swap stuff secondhand like used sofa barely hangin years know could give away free also legitimate fear bedbugs going secondhand harder get rid back used gnarliest pesticides known man going play devils advocate think dumpsters encourage people accumulating waste think absence would discourage think negative things come people opportunities far fetched know large items chairs couches get left side road critters pests make homes great someone else may pick bring house days weeks unwanted pests may require chemicals get rid people put large non recyclable items recycling bin grew recycling bins bigger trash bins city supplied see people use recycling bins overflow trash bins especially large items extra trash ends street never gets picked unfortunately lot items commonly get dumped side rural road avoid pay dispose harm reduction way think correct word city waste offers three bulk waste pickups per year call schedule waste company says try reuse stuff appropriate vs going straight dump way know tbh previous city one bulk trash pickup per year instead streets per week always pickup trucks cruising streets collection trucks came would grab things thought could reused resold sense pretty good reuse likelihood people area use large dumpsters toss things like soiled mattresses construction waste getting upcycled last bulky things tossed two broken salvageable recyclable shower doors remember repair one rs always things need tossed house parts happen rather large waste repaired less waste overall repair still good thing example shower doors literally ancient much past usable lifespan something originally installed want make event zero waste ask organizers willing include blurb advertising buy nothing groups dumpster advertisments get rid somewhat usable upcycable items first prior dumpster day phrase know dumpster always fills promoting buy nothing groups might good way get room dumpser without increasing costs rent
Low / no waste sunscreen?,"I work outside and in the summertime I MUST wear sunscreen everyday or else I will get serious burns. In my locality I am able to recycle my sunscreen lotion bottles which is a huge help, but as I prepare for the warmer months I would love to find a sustainable sunscreen brand. Does anyone know of sunscreen brands with uniquely zero waste packaging or low impact formulas? I currently use a ""reef safe"" bottle, but am dubious of its true impacts.","minimize where you can (ie buying in bunk or wearing uv-protective clothes) but if sunscreen isn‚Äôt something you can safely switch out, don‚Äôt. melanoma causes more waste and pain. || Putting on adequate sunscreen will prevent all the waste from later skin cancer treatments. I wouldn't stress too much in this area. Get a sunscreen you'll apply often- that's the most important thing. This should really be treated like a medical necessity.

Rocky Mountain sunscreen in the US sells affordable gallon size sunscreens || I have taken to wearing UPF clothing in the summer if I‚Äôm going to be out for extended periods in the sun as I burn really easily. I have a few long sleeve lightweight shirts that are UPF 50. They aren‚Äôt made of the most sustainable fabrics, but they are much more sustainable than if I were to get skin cancer. 

Additionally, for areas not covered by the shirt, Little Hands Hawaii has some great mineral sunscreens that come in either cardboard tubes or metal tins depending on the type. And they have tinted and non-tinted options in a variety of shades. It is great stuff! 

I do have one mineral sunscreen that comes in a normal tube, because it doesn‚Äôt smudge at all, while my other sunscreen sometimes smudges on my clothes. I use this when I am wearing something nicer or going somewhere I need to be more dressed up. I save the other sunscreen for when I‚Äôll be doing yard work or swimming or hiking where it‚Äôs not a big deal if a little gets on my clothes and when I need it to be water resistant. 

I try my best to be sustainable with sun protection, but I also recognize that it needs to be something effective and habit sustaining for me in order to preserve my health. || If you want to spend a lot, but it's good quality, Supergoop brand had a giant dispenser at Sephora of their Play sunscreen.¬†


I would also look at Costco for large packaged sunscreen.¬†


Also, a giant hat, sun hoody, long sleeve sun SPF clothing, long pants could all be cheaper and more reusable options to reduce overall sun exposure.¬† || Badger comes in tins. they sell clear zinc and are reef safe. || The most sustainable option is to invest in a quality sun hat and loose long layers. They also make sleeves for gardening that protect your arms. || I know there's some brands out there that come in metal tins. 

But you can also look into buying larger quantity (like by the gallon) and use an applicator (I got Sun Buddy for use with my toddler and it works great and holds a lot of sunscreen at once). || Attitude has ones in paperboard packaging! It‚Äôs pretty clean and reef safe || >I currently use a ""reef safe"" bottle, but am dubious of its true impacts.

The claim that sunscreen harms coral reefs has been blown way out of proportion. Sunscreen isn't the main cause of coral bleaching.

"""Least bad"" packaging for produce?","Hi there, I run a small farm. We try to reduce our impact as much as possible. We managed to packaging free for a few years, but to be viable, we do have to package some products (mostly baby leaf greens) for some of our outlets (we have good relationships with a few stores that sell our salad by bulk bin, but that doesn't work for all our outlets). 

We feel very befuddled on whether compostable packaging is actually any better than conventional plastics that can be recyclied, plant-based plastics, etc

There's heaps of greenwashing, and increasingly it seems microplastics and other toxins are being found in compostable packaging - composting them back into food systems can be pretty problematic. Home compostables often aren't (we don't have commercial composting in my area yet). I don't know how to weigh that against the huge quantity of recycling that never gets recycled, the intensive energy use that comes from that etc.

On top of that compostable options can be 30x more expensive than conventional plastics. The plant based plastics are less expensive, but still significantly more expensive. We'd need to put our prices up 5-10% on a number of products to cover the cost, and we want to stay affordable.

For those of you who've done a deep dive, could you share some thoughts and/or resources to get my head around this a bit better?

","Hello! While we are happy to host this conversation, if anyone is interested in more talk about veganism and zero waste, you should also check out /r/PlantBased4ThePlanet and /r/ZeroWasteVegans!

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/ZeroWaste) if you have any questions or concerns.* || I didn't want to make the OP super wordy, but as people are giving me lots of nice alternative ideas, some things I'd like to add a few things:
1) I've been running this farm for 2 years, the vast majority of what we do is packaging free. We have convinced retailers to install bulk refill bins for salad greens, we run a csa where people fill their own containers. Less than 10% of what we sell is packaged.


2) the bulk bin option doesn't work for all stores. Either practically, or for food safety rules in their context. We have to sell produce to survive. We aren't in a position to righteously refuse working with these stores. Additionally when we run tests with bulk bins next to bagged product, the bagged product sells 2-3x faster by volume - even though it's more expensive.

3) sealed containers (doesn't have to be bags, someone suggested returnable containers - e.g. jars, which was a cool idea albeit not logistically feasible in the short term) are 100% required for baby greens to have good shelf life. Paper does not work. At all. || I'm a packaging engineer specialized in sustainable packaging. Compostable packaging is more expensive and likely isn't getting composted in an industrial facility when your customers take it home. 

If the bag is certified through BPI, that means it is compostable in an industrial composting process. That means high heat and consistent moisture are necessary to compost the bag. A home compost pile will never maintain the temperature and moisture needed to compost those types in a timely manner. 

If the bags are certified through TUV as Home Compostable, they can be composted in home compost piles. 

Overall, I would say that if the bags aren't being properly composted, it isn't worth it. They are more expensive and going to the landfill, where they will produce methane as they break down. 

When looking at a Life Cycle Analysis comparison, I would look for bags containing PCR (Post Consumer Recycled content) or a polyethylene bag that can be taken back to stores and recycled in the Store Dropoff program. 

I'm happy to answer any questions you have!

Edit: DO NOT BUY ""BIODEGRADABLE"" PLASTIC BAGS. They have additives in them that just make microplastics faster. This is not a legitimate claim and is actually banned in a few countries. The FTC in the US also has a rule against this, but it just isn't enforced.

Edit2: the store dropoff program at stores does get recycled. Most of it goes into Trex decking. || Honestly I think your best bet is plastic that is sturdy enough to be reused at the customer‚Äôs end. A flimsy film plastic container has 1 life, a slightly sturdier container has multiple before it breaks. A ‚Äúreuse me!‚Äù sticker on the box could also do some good. || Re compostable bags what has worked here is the local shop chain asked the council (who collect food waste) what bags would be best suited for their food waste composter, they agreed on a bag publicised it could be used to dispose of food waste, made it distinctive so the binmen knew it was ok by sight to go in the food waste, people now use their bags to store their food waste which is cheaper and superior to a paper bag alternative in terms of hygiene and cleaning. || Probably glass jars because those are endlessly recyclable but shipping would turn into a nightmare || Hi! Very cool that you‚Äôve been able to be mostly plastic free, I think that‚Äôs a big feat for most growers in general. Good job!

Most of the growers I work with send their produce to an intermediary that packages things for them and the growers don‚Äôt really get a say nor do they care what their produce gets packaged in. 

BUT I‚Äôve heard from composting companies that the ‚Äúcompostable‚Äù plastic is actually terrible because it‚Äôs not actually breaking down. Also, the distinction between ‚Äúbackyard compostable‚Äù and ‚Äúindustrial compostable‚Äù is not usually made so consumers are confused, rightfully so. I hear that biodegradable plastic is the best because it‚Äôs actually breaking down, which is what you want in compost. 

Someone else mentioned that it might be good to just use the conventional plastic so people can reuse it, but I think the average person would toss their plastic. You might have a different sample of folks buying your produce that WOULD reuse, maybe include a printout of a QR code for a survey to ask what your customers want? Your produce box customers might be willing to do that and you‚Äôd be able to get a better idea of what your base is like || I‚Äôm a packaging engineer ( w a degree in Packaging. What do you want to know? Also idk if they help out non-MI based businesses, but Michigan State has an office that works w the school of packaging to help businesses with packaging issues like this. || Many others have given good answers, but ill add something I saw from someone who runs a roadside egg stand on instagram:

She gets asked constantly why she doesnt use the paper cartons and she has stated many times that, since she stores her eggs in a cooler at the stand, the moisture breaks them down leading to broken (and wasted) eggs. Not to mention they are not reusable. So she uses slightly sturdier plastic cartons that she has a return bin for. She gets almost all of them back with her return customers and is able to wash and resuse them hundreds of times. || Can I ask what kind of produce it is?",85,ZeroWaste,2025-05-31 12:23:52,least bad packaging produce,hi run small farm try reduce impact much possible managed packaging free years viable package products mostly baby leaf greens outlets good relationships stores sell salad bulk bin work outlets feel befuddled whether compostable packaging actually better conventional plastics recyclied plant based plastics etc heaps greenwashing increasingly seems microplastics toxins found compostable packaging composting back food systems pretty problematic home compostables often commercial composting area yet know weigh huge quantity recycling never gets recycled intensive energy use comes etc top compostable options x expensive conventional plastics plant based plastics less expensive still significantly expensive need put prices number products cover cost want stay affordable done deep dive could share thoughts resources get head around bit better,hello happy host conversation anyone interested talk veganism zero waste also check r plantbasedtheplanet r zerowastevegans bot action performed automatically please contact moderators subreddit message compose r zerowaste questions concerns want make op super wordy people giving lots nice alternative ideas things like add things running farm years vast majority packaging free convinced retailers install bulk refill bins salad greens run csa people fill containers less sell packaged bulk bin option work stores either practically food safety rules context sell produce survive position righteously refuse working stores additionally run tests bulk bins next bagged product bagged product sells x faster volume even though expensive sealed containers bags someone suggested returnable containers e g jars cool idea albeit logistically feasible short term required baby greens good shelf life paper work packaging engineer specialized sustainable packaging compostable packaging expensive likely getting composted industrial facility customers take home bag certified bpi means compostable industrial composting process means high heat consistent moisture necessary compost bag home compost pile never maintain temperature moisture needed compost types timely manner bags certified tuv home compostable composted home compost piles overall would say bags properly composted worth expensive going landfill produce methane break looking life cycle analysis comparison would look bags containing pcr post consumer recycled content polyethylene bag taken back stores recycled store dropoff program happy answer questions edit buy biodegradable plastic bags additives make microplastics faster legitimate claim actually banned countries ftc us also rule enforced edit store dropoff program stores get recycled goes trex decking honestly think best bet plastic sturdy enough reused customer end flimsy film plastic container life slightly sturdier container multiple breaks reuse sticker box could also good compostable bags worked local shop chain asked council collect food waste bags would best suited food waste composter agreed bag publicised could used dispose food waste made distinctive binmen knew ok sight go food waste people use bags store food waste cheaper superior paper bag alternative terms hygiene cleaning probably glass jars endlessly recyclable shipping would turn nightmare hi cool able mostly plastic free think big feat growers general good job growers work send produce intermediary packages things growers really get say care produce gets packaged heard composting companies compostable plastic actually terrible actually breaking also distinction backyard compostable industrial compostable usually made consumers confused rightfully hear biodegradable plastic best actually breaking want compost someone else mentioned might good use conventional plastic people reuse think average person would toss plastic might different sample folks buying produce would reuse maybe include printout qr code survey ask customers want produce box customers might willing able get better idea base like packaging engineer w degree packaging want know also idk help non mi based businesses michigan state office works w school packaging help businesses packaging issues like many others given good answers ill add something saw someone runs roadside egg stand instagram gets asked constantly doesnt use paper cartons stated many times since stores eggs cooler stand moisture breaks leading broken wasted eggs mention reusable uses slightly sturdier plastic cartons return bin gets almost back return customers able wash resuse hundreds times ask kind produce
how to find affordable liability insurance (food recovery charity),"our family runs a food recovery charity that diverts extra food from commercial kitchens that would otherwise go to the landfill, and gets it served in local shelters. very grass roots but we diverted 4000+ pounds this way last year. it's a free service we provide. we are 85% self funded 

we have the opportunity to partner with a local entertainment complex that could increase our volumes by 35%. but they want us to provide all kinds of liability insurance coverage as we don't have (4-5MM). 

nonprofit insurance place sees too much risk (225/month) and small business places don't understand and can't figure out how to quote it ("" you aren't a soup kitchen but you're more than a delivery agent ...."")

any ideas? we could rescue easily an extra 150-200 meals a month this way so I don't want to dismiss it. but high barrier to entry

are there any green or sustainable business insurers? or someone who would work with us? ideas? thanks ",,9,ZeroWaste,2025-05-31 04:56:28,find affordable liability insurance food recovery charity,family runs food recovery charity diverts extra food commercial kitchens would otherwise go landfill gets served local shelters grass roots diverted pounds way last year free service provide self funded opportunity partner local entertainment complex could increase volumes want us provide kinds liability insurance coverage mm nonprofit insurance place sees much risk month small business places understand figure quote soup kitchen delivery agent ideas could rescue easily extra meals month way want dismiss high barrier entry green sustainable business insurers someone would work us ideas thanks,
What are cheaper alternatives to popular cleaning products that work just as well or better?,"Trying to cut down on cleaning costs but I‚Äôm not interested in making anything myself. No DIY stuff at all. I‚Äôm looking for store bought alternatives to big name products like Windex, Swiffer pads, Lysol wipes, and Clorox wipes. I don‚Äôt mind switching to off brands or lesser known products if they clean just as well or even better. If you‚Äôve found any cheaper items that surprised you with how good they are, I‚Äôd love to hear about them. Open to recommendations for anything from glass cleaners to floor cleaners and disinfecting wipes.","Rags from old clothes that you rinse well, wash, and reuse.  Throw em in with any laundry load. || OP said no DIY, yet all the comment are DIY üòÇ I‚Äôve ordered Grove Collaborative‚Äôs concentrated cleaners before and been very happy with them. They ship in tiny glass bottles, then the ONLY thing you ‚Äúdo yourself‚Äù is mix them with water into a regular-sized spray bottle and shake. No plastic, and mine have lasted me at least three years since I ordered them. Not the most zero waste alternative, but certainly more recyclable and lower waste! || Regular vinegar. 

Better than windex for windows. 
Makes everything sparkle. 
The smell does not last at all. 
And it‚Äôs safe and healthy to use around kids and pets. 

You can just do full strength vinegar in a spray bottle. but I know some people like to dilute it.
Personally, I like to have a spray bottle with vinegar and a tablespoon of dawn. I don‚Äôt add water bc it isn‚Äôt necessary and can potentially contaminate my cleaner. I don‚Äôt use the soapy mixture on glass/windows unless they are particularly filthy. 


Also, some people will tell you to mix baking soda and vinegar together and don‚Äôt do that. It‚Äôs literally a waste of vinegar and baking soda they make each other inert. 

People will say ‚Äúbut the bubbles are the cleaning action‚Äù. But no, not really. It‚Äôs a weak reaction at best and, again, leaves both agents completely inert and useless. || You asked for no DIY, and honestly I don‚Äôt classify this as DIY becuase it takes one step. And it‚Äôs so easy and SO CHEAP!!!. I think it‚Äôs an underrated hack for cleaning cheap and low waste. And honestly most people don‚Äôt need to disinfect all the time like they think they do! It‚Äôs very hard on your skin/body/environment using harsh cleaning products a lot. But you do you haha 

This is what I do- I clean nearly everything with Castile soap and water and just dilute as needed. Works for 95% of messes. I buy a gallon of casitlle soap off of Amazon, and pour it into spray bottles with water for cleaning countertops, do the same for my spray mop for the floors. And it works for cleaning glass/mirrors too. I also use it for hand soap, just get a foaming hand soap dispenser and dilute with water and it comes out perfectly. 

It‚Äôs nearly zero waste (cuts down on the packing of all these individual cleaning products by like 90%).  

I don‚Äôt really use Clorox or Lysol, or very sparingly, when I need to clean a toilet or something, it‚Äôs very harsh on you and the environment, so it cuts my costs down and is less waste. Hope this helps! :) || Comet for toilet cleaner. Cheap, works great, and the packaging has minimal plastic || Not sure if you'd call this DIY. The BEST thing I have ever used on my stainless steel appliances is rubbing alcohol (Isopropyl). After it took off the years of accumulated ""cleaners"" (a lot of which are just oil or wax to cover the mess and shine it up) maintenance has been a snap. No streaks, no work. || I‚Äôm going to get a hypochlorous acid generator to make a disinfectant that‚Äôs safer than bleach but supposedly more effective. All you need if you get the Eco One is vinegar, non iodized salt and water, but Force of Nature has those ingredients you need in little packages. I‚Äôd rather just do it myself with the Eco One than create more waste || Simple Green.  You buy it as concentrate (a gallon is like $15 at Lowes/HD) and dilute 10/1.  That gallon will last years. || Vinegar is pretty good all around and Dawn soap. You don‚Äôt need a lot. Rubbing alcohol. 

Many do it yourself replacements for conventional products include basics like these. Water, drops of Dawn and some isopropyl alcohol. 

You can read labels and safety data sheets. You don‚Äôt need to understand chemistry. If product has some ingredients missing it may not be that big a deal. 

But you may have a little more elbow grease cleaning or actually hand drying because some of the missing ingredients make it spot free drying or keeping something like calcium or magnesium (hardness) from caking || I use hydrogen peroxide (the brown bottle at the dollar store) with a spray top to clean my (gas) stove top and (over the stove) microwave. Also excellent for bathroom mirrors. || I  user Dr Bronnes soap for most of our needs -from hand washing to floor washing. I use alcohol and water for my cleaning -make granite look fabulous. Rags and bucket, and some old fashion scrubbing.  I also have a steam mop. || Cut up old towels or cotton clothing for cleaning rags. 

My favorite cleaners are seventh generation free and clear all purpose cleaner and Barkeeper's. I also use seventh generation hand soap, dish soap, and sometimes laundry detergent. I buy the largest refill bottles in bulk. I water down the all purpose cleaner 2 parts water to 1 part cleaner for most surfaces. In the kitchen, I heavily dilute the dish soap in a spray bottle for my kitchen counters and appliances. When I need a heavy duty cleaner, I tend to use Barkeeper's Friend. You don't need a lot for it to work.

I probably buy the cleaners once a year and then just refill and dilute as needed. || Not sure if you consider this DIY but stopped buying most targeted cleaning stuff since I got pets. Now I only keep one bottle of bleach, one of isopropyl alcohol, one of hydrogen peroxide, one of vinegar, and one of Dawn Soap. I still have the Pink Stuff which works like magic for my stainless steel pots and pans... Not sure what to replace it with tbh.

- I use bleach to clean my toilet, and my cleaning rags.
- I use isopropyl alcohol (I like some pet safe essential oils for smell but unnecessary) to disinfect toilet seat and outside, door handles, stainless steel appliances, all glass/mirrors, light switches, remotes, and electronics. I get one rag for each category and dunk it in alcohol, dust first obvs.
- I use hydrogen peroxide mixed with water to disinfect my granite countertops, wooden cutting boards, inside of fridge and microwave, garbage cans, sink and shower. All of this would be previously cleaned with regular dawn soap and water. I also use it to disinfect my groceries. I have rags that just live in the solution, it's a lot like Clorox wipes.
- I give my produce a vinegar and water bath. This is DIY but I made my wood clean/polish with citrus peel vinegar mixed with mineral oil, which I already had for conditioning my wooden cutting boards.

For my floors, and upholstery than cannot be washed, I have a Dupray Steamer. I have cats and I am allergic, so I bought knowing it kills allergens, and that most cleaners can be toxic to pets. It eliminated the need for floor, carpet, or upholstery cleaning chemicals. I clean my entire bathroom with steam about once a month. || I basically clean everything with citric acit. In Germany you can buy it as a powder in paper packaging in most stores. A package costs 2-3‚Ç¨ and lasts for multiple months. Just mix it with water and it works perfectly for cleaning the kitchen and bathroom. You can use any rug (bought or reused) you like for it. I prefer it over vinegar, because it doesn't really smell. You could of course mix some perfume in the liquid, if you like the smell. || I started making a homemade mix scouring powder instead of the store mixes. There are loads of recipes online, but I can't find the one I used right now. It was a combination of baking soda, borax, salt, and lemon oil. Works great, costs next to nothing per container.

  
Also tea towels! We still have paper towels, but only for the super gross stuff. The tea towels are better at cleaning and drying than the paper anyway. We also grabbed some microfiber cloths that have replaced swiffers for us. They pick up dust as well, and then just go in the laundry. || I mostly use dish soap amd water for a lot of things. I use the Grove dish soap that comes in the aluminum bottle. I have a lot of different products that come in plastic like soft scrub, bkf, zep hardwood floor cleaner, but I try to buy the biggest size possible and only use if when soap and water fails. Having a good scouring pad helps too for baked on stuff. I found some made of coconut husks so they're plastic free and very rough. || A gallon of Simple Green concentrate will last you forever. It can be used for cleaning, laundry, stain removal, disinfectant, multiple different surfaces and it‚Äôs pretty safe compared to most other cleaners. Add a few tablespoons to your spray bottle and fill with water. You can make it stronger if needed for clothes or really dirty surfaces. My mom used to clean houses and she cleaned almost everything with it. It won‚Äôt give you streak free shine on mirrors though but it will wash them. || Very hot water for greasy pans. Super hot. First step is to scrape as much out of the pan as possible (disposing of it properly). Then boil water in a kettle and pour the boiling water in the pot/pan. That cuts the grease like no one's business. || Vinegar for Windex replacement. good old white, less-than-a-dollar-per-liter vinegar.

swifter pads.. isn't it just a disposable wet rag with or without soap? Can't really help, as it's simply a cheap disposable mop head.

lysol wipes.. isn't it like swiffer pads but for countertops? I use rags and soap that I wash instead of throwing away. Do the laundry duties fall in the no-diy category? 

clorox  wipes.. What is that? more throwaway tissues but this time with bleach I suppose? never heard of it. just wash your rags.

Cleaning has always been simple if you don't follow the commercials gimmicks.
baking soda and whatever cheapest liquid multi-purpose soap you can get for most of everything else.

soap and water that you wash with either a rag for surfaces not walked on or a mop for walk able surfaces.

baking soda is used as an abrasive in combination with the soapy wet rag talked about previously. I use it to wash sinks, toilets, shower walls, bathtub, burnt cookwares, etc.

you can add a bunch of products to pair with such as essential oils or whatnot, but baking soda, vinegar and multi-purpose soap is all you need. and water, oups.

Wash you rags and don't buy disposable wipes and you solved 50% of your struggle.

Society has a fucked up view on disposables vs washables. || What I always have is this:  Something I can spray - I use pinesol or the store knock off, and dilute it - you don't have to use it full strength for just wiping down the counter or whatever,  something soapy (like dish liquid) and something scour-y (like Comet or Ajax powder).  

I USED to clean my whole apartment with cheap store-brand windex and dish soap and baking soda.  I would buy baking soda in the big swimming-pool use bag at walmart and have it for years.  baking soda can clean a toilet, a bathtub, scour your stove messes also, and you can make a paste with it

"Realized my ""eco-friendly"" bathroom still creates tons of plastic waste","I‚Äôve switched to shampoo bars, bamboo toothbrushes, and safety razors and thought I was doing great with plastic reduction.

Then I counted our oral care waste for a month:

* 2 toothpaste tubes (family of 4)  
* Mouthwash bottle  
* Plastic floss containers  
* Even our gum comes in plastic blister packs  
* The kids go through 2-3 sparkly toothpaste tubes on their own  

It‚Äôs honestly discouraging. I‚Äôve cut down plastic almost everywhere except this one category, and it‚Äôs something we use every day.

I tried toothpaste tablets, but they taste like chalk and the kids hate them. Homemade stuff separates and tastes terrible.

Has anyone actually found a zero-waste oral care solution that works for adults and picky kids? Would help me a loot thanks ","How much toothpaste are you kids using? That seems like a lot of toothpaste for a month. Also, my kids will only use the little plastic handled flossers and I hate the plastic waste, but I figure their oral hygiene is more important. I use compostable floss in a refillable bamboo dispenser, so maybe that helps cancel it out? My point is, I won‚Äôt kill myself to be perfect. I do my best and hope everyone else does, too. || You shouldn‚Äôt stress yourself out so much. It‚Äôs impossible to go zero waste, you should always do your best though when you can. || check out japanese dental care - specifically their HAp stuff. been using their gum for 4 months, way better than tablets   zero waste packaging || [removed] || Don‚Äôt skimp on the toothpaste. I don‚Äôt think homemade or tablet versions are as effective for maintaining healthy teeth as the conventional stuff. Just buy the biggest tubes you can so there‚Äôs less packaging per use. 
For the kids, try to help them with the brushing so they only put as much toothpaste as they need onto the brush, not too much. 
But I think it‚Äôs one of those areas where you just reduce as much as you can, and then make peace. 

I second others- I don‚Äôt know that mouthwash is necessary. My dentist recommends a high fluoride one to swish around, but the minty breath freshening one? Not sure it does much for you other than just helping breath. So maybe it can just be an as needed thing, or replace with breath mints, if that‚Äôs the motivation? || The waste that would be generated from having fillings will be far more than the toothpaste tubes! 

Though as I understand it, current advice is not to use mouthwash, as it contains less flouride than toothpaste, and just washes off the more beneficial toothpaste residue. || As someone with fillings and parents who got extensive dental work (think missing a minimum of 1/2 their teeth): teeth are more important || * Stop using mouthwash
* If you want to chew gum buy those cupholder-style containers that have 60+ pieces in one container, rather than blister packages of 12.
* For floss you can pay a slight premium to get non-plastic packaging, like [EcoDent](https://www.eco-dent.com/catalog/category/view/s/gentlefloss/id/22/) or similar. Or you can pay a super premium to get floss made from non-plastic materials. Or you can accept that floss is okay way to generate waste. Your call.
* For toothpaste make sure you're using a right-sized amount - it's less than you think! If you're doing that a person should only go through a tube once every few months, and that level of waste generation is acceptable for health benefits. || I‚Äôm currently in dental hygiene school and I‚Äôm seeing a lot of good advice from others. I‚Äôll also add:

You really only need 1g of toothpaste for adults (a little smaller than the size of a pea) , and an even smaller ‚Äúsmear‚Äù for kids. One tube of kids toothpaste should last one kid at least 1 month - often more. Davids is a paste that comes in an aluminum tube that can be cleaned off and recycled with your other aluminum recycling - it is unfortunately fluoride free, so I highly recommend using a fluoridated mouthwash with it! 

Floss before using mouthwash or brushing! I use a brand called Dental Lace. It‚Äôs made of silk and comes in compostable packaging - they also have a glass tube with a metal lid for ease of access. Silk is better than most other types of floss in more than environmental standards - it‚Äôs a multifilament! Monofilaments like polyester don‚Äôt remove plaque as well as multifilament flosses. 

Use mouthwash before brushing! You don‚Äôt need much mouthwash either - just barely enough to swish with. I personally use the brand Therabreath. It comes in a plastic bottle, but it is curbside recyclable where I live - I have also seen someone on the internet turn their therabreath mouthwash bottle into 3D printer filament (in case you‚Äôre into 3D printing lol). There are other types of mouthwash out there - like tabs that are dissolved in water, but I haven‚Äôt used them or done much research into their ingredient lists so I can‚Äôt make a definitive recommendation for them || You are probably loading the toothbrushes so they look like what's featured on the ad. You only need a blob about the size of a pea to do a good job for brushing your teeth. My tubes last a very long time and when it gets hard to get those last bits out, I cut the tube open. || Quip has a reusable floss pick. They send you a little wheel of floss in a small cardboard thing at whatever interval, and you pop it into the holder thing. It also lets you use a lot less floss. They also have toothpaste in supposedly recyclable tubes. The kids one is watermelon, and my daughter likes it.

In general though, personal dental waste is exponentially less than dental appointment waste, so it's an area that a little extra slip is not terrible || Gum itself is plastic, so I would recommend cutting that out if your goal is zero plastic waste. 

I can‚Äôt think of a replacement - depends what purpose you use it for. If it‚Äôs just an oral fixation thing, maybe a toothpick. If it‚Äôs for freshening the breath, maybe mints? Altoids still come in the metal containers, I think. || I‚Äôve seen silk floss in glass and cardboard. 
I‚Äôve also seen toothpaste (both with and without fluoride) in tabs that are in glass containers. 
Most gum is a type of plastic, I‚Äôd just cut that. 
If that‚Äôs the toothpaste your kids will use, let them use it as regular oral care at home will use less waste than dental work. But I‚Äôd check what the sparkles are made of. 

Some toothpaste comes in aluminum containers. But the main one I know of [has a lot of lead in it](https://tamararubin.com/2025/01/toothpaste-chart/), so I‚Äôd avoid David‚Äôs. || ‚ÄòSolid‚Äô does a toothpaste paste in a glass jar. 

‚ÄòHuppy‚Äô does toothpaste tablets but they don‚Äôt taste great - BUT their mouthwash is really good imo (spicy) 

Gum base is not really regulated and will often be made out of plastic so I would probably stop consuming it all together but I totally get that it‚Äôs hard. 

They do have some low waste options for floss but I can‚Äôt give any suggestions. || I worry about the amount of toothpaste you guys go through a month.  We‚Äôre two adults and a 10yo and our toothpaste tubes lasts‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember when we last changed it but at least two months.  2 per months plus 3 for the small kids is surprising.

For the mouthwash, can you try to see if you can buy jumbo bottles (and refill a reusable bottle of more convenient)?  Still plastic bottles but 1 giant plastic bottle vs 2-3 small ones‚Ä¶ || Anyone else obsessed with larineco? game changer for my sensitive teeth ü¶∑ || Quit with the gum. It's unnecessary, and usually made of plastic. Mouthwash isn't necessary either. Don't worry about producing waste with toothpaste tubes and floss, it's worth it. Sounds like you're going through waaaaay more toothpaste than you need to though, so check how much the kids are using. || There are so many amazing toothpaste tabs, but they take a little getting used to. Some are really smooth and some are chalky. I like Huppy and Lush- Unpaste is the cheapest I've found. Kids love Superbee Dentos tabs. || dude don't sleep on getting better floss like Smart Floss! it comes in a paper container, much less plastic waste and it cleans SO much better. also for toothpaste, you only need a pea sized amount or less to wash with so while yes you will go through more than a single person it should be less than 2 tubes a month!

*(I'm not a dentist or any kind of health professional, definitely do your own research, but you could try brushing with a home-mixed tooth cleaning powder? Some people like it... again not sure how good of a recommendation that is...)*

Edit: Smart Floss isn't minty so maybe your kids would like that better since it doesn't sting at all. It's cardamom flavored! plus most floss is plastic on top of the packaging.

Starting my Zero Waste Journey!,"Not sure if this is the technical use for this flair, but starting on my zero waste journey is a win in my book, so I'm gonna roll with it!

Anyway, tonight, I made some good first steps in cutting down on waste! I probably won't be able to do as much as some of y'all (hello, chronic illnesses) due to money and time constraints, but I want to do what I can. Scrolling through the posts on here, it's amazing what some of you do!

My first step was ordering a soda maker to help cut down on SparklingIce bottles. Several hours and lots of brand comparisons later, I settled on the OmniFizz. If it turns out to be a good purchase, I will see about switching from the small canisters to an adapter and a large CO2 tank. Seemed like this had mixed results in leakage and taste.

My second step was researching cat litter. Again lol. While I've done lots of research in the past to make sure the litter isn't toxic to the cats (like using cobalt chloride to dye the litter) while still being as affordable as possible, I hadn't considered more sustainable options, as it seemed like most of them mold easily. I can't scoop every day, so I have a PetSafe Scoop Free Automatic Litter Box, which allows me to completely change the litter every 3-4 weeks (two boxes for two cats). Many natural litters + liquid sitting in it = mold. BUT, tonight, I found out you can use pine pellets as litter. Not sure how I didn't think about that before, considering I used to clean stalls to ride horses, but at least it's been thought of now.

I'm also hoping to find some ways I can cut down on food packaging. I haven't been able to cook much for the last 6 months, which means I buy a lot of packaged food. Buying bigger quantities can help some, but if you're buying granola bars, for example, they're still wrapped individually. Hopefully, as I get better, I can get back into cooking, which will be better for me and the environment! (Ideas are welcome for this, btw - though I live in a rural area, so no Costco or Sam's Club-like stores for big bulk buys).

Thank you all for inspiring me to take some good first steps! I hope to knock out some more impactful changes first and make a list of smaller changes to implement as I can/need a new thing.","Cutting down your driving are probably the most impactful in your r/ZeroWaste journey. || Way to go! üëè You have a great start! Other ideas: learning to mend clothing, decreasing paper towel usage, taking shorter showers, silicone muffin liners, using the library, and reusable grocery bags || We've been using a Cat Genie litter box (multiple cat Genies now due to house layout and number of cats) since about 2010 and are very happy with it. We have the original version that washes itself everytime a cat uses it. The litter granules are reused instead of clumped and disposed of. Those granules that do end up being discarded are septic safe and degrade in that environment. [Cat Genie webiste](https://www.catgenie.com/) || Some changes that won't cost extra effort in the long run:
- Don't shave or use a safety razor
- Use a menstrual cup or menstrual underwear or pads, those take more effort but might increase comfort
- Don't use bin bags, use other bags you got instead
- Use the library. Even if you can only use the online library you support sharing.
- Buy less stuff and if you buy buy second hand especially technology. 

For food:
- What you eat is more impactful than the packaging. Try to go for a more plant based diet. 
- Is there a food sharing initiative near you? A friend of mine cooks extra for a neighbour who just pays for the ingredients. It is like a buddy system, they are coupled and she brings by some food every week or so. She uses reusable packaging. If you join you can get some nice homecooked meals. The Dutch website is. https://thuisgekookt.nl/ (you can change the language settings to English at the menu on the top right corner)
- You can also ask loved ones to share a meal more often. Even if you don't have energy to be social during a meal, people might be willing to just cook some extra for you.
- Even though mono taskers are usually advised against in the zero waste community, they can prevent waste if handling a knive is hard due to disability. So if you find something that makes cutting manageable consider buying it. There are a lot of these second hand, since for most people just using a knive works fine.
- Use your oven and freezer. Get some recipes that basically say to put everything in the oven and then put the oven on. This means you don't have to actively cook that much. You can take a little break until your food is ready. If you cook double and freeze the extra the second meal is even easier as you only have to heat it up. || Hi,

great start! For us it took quit some time to figure out how and where we can cut down on plastics. And in some cases we are still not able to cut down on plastics.

Some simple tips that should work anywhere in the world:

* get yourself a stainless steel or glas water bottle and refill it 
* Always bring a Container for food leftovers to a restaurant.
* Get yourself some (cotton) Bags to use them instead of plastic bags when you are shopping.
* shop in small local stores and ask if they fill your container directly. For example i go to a local coffee Roastery  and they fill my coffee box directly. No plastic bag needed.
* If bulk buying is no option, maybe try to find some other ppl who want to cut down on plastic and order big amounts online and split it up?
* In some cases you wont find a plastic free version that simple (like your canola bar example) but most of the time you can at least find a better version with less waste. 

  
Enjoy your journey ! || Check out your local refillery:

https://refill.directory/ || Welcome!! I am not nearly zero waste but also trying my best. My top tips to get started are:
* Buy in bulk when you can 
* reuse everything, if I buy something that comes in a plastic bag, I will try to reuse it, same for lots of different things. Be creative!
*limit eating out or bring your own container with you to bring leftovers home 
* get a glass or stainless steel bottle for water and always bring with you, same for getting coffee or tea out. I bring my own thermos. 
* bring your own bags to the store, even if all you have right now are old plastic ones
* don‚Äôt waste food! Eat leftovers, use ALL of things. 
* if you can reduce what products you buy for cleaning purposes: ie I use rags to clean instead of paper towels. I use a big jug of Castile soap for nearly all my cleaning purposes and add to spray bottles, my spray mop, I use as hand soap too( I just dilute it with water depending on the need).

Need help finding the least-impact dog poop bag material,"Hello, I have a question regarding dog waste bags. As far as I understand, it all ends up in a landfill (I can't compost) so people argue it won't matter if they're plastic or biodegradable bags.

However, wouldn't biodegradable bags be better, because they use less plastic to begin with? Sure, they won't decompose in a landfill, but at least they've been made using plants and not virgin plastic. Am I better off buying bags made from recycled plastic instead? What if they're burnt in an incinerator?

I am aware of other ways to reduce waste, this is just for times when I need to use a bag.

Thanks for taking time to read my post. 

","Best option is bags you can't avoid getting.

I have used litter like empty chip bags to clean up dog poop before, or dirty soda cups. || I use Who Gives a Crap, which I believe are 100% recycled plastic. Great company for TP too || Go on your local buy nothing group and ask for someone to give you their hoard of plastic grocery bags or steal some from the recycling plastic bag bin in many grocery stores. || This is a great question. I have been using biodegradable poop bags for the reason you stated - less plastic overall. 

I recently looked to see if I could find bags made from 100% recycled plastic instead but couldn‚Äôt find any, at least that were comparable in price to the biodegradable bags I buy, so decided to just continue using what I have been using. 

We already wash and reuse things like bread bags for food storage (including homemade bread), and recycle the ones that are too worn to use anymore (they don‚Äôt go in the trash). Plastic grocery bags were outlawed in our town, so we don‚Äôt have very many extra ones lying around for poop, as another poster suggested using. Not going to use paper bags since we usually go on long walks or hikes, and ewww.

If you find affordable 100% recycled dog poop bags, let me know! || My friend uses biodegradable bags, then composts the bag after picking up the waste. But this compost is ONLY used in her flower garden. 

I just use bags that were destined to be garbaged. || Reuse bags you already have, like from bread or tortillas or veggies. The green ""eco friendly"" poop bags are technically compostable so I try to get those, figuring they're probably slightly lesser of the two evils. I don't compost them but I hope they actually break down faster in the landfill. (Who really knows, but they're pretty much the same price so it doesn't matter that much) || I currently collect my cats poop in paper bags. You can also make your own paper bags from newspapers if you want to take the time to. The other comments are good suggestions as well! || I have cats and use the plastic packaging of things like toilet paper and other bulk products to line their litter drawer whenever possible.

I used to use them for emergencies in my diaper bag, for baby diapers.
Well, didn‚Äôt use them a ton. Forgot about them. Until suddenly with there was a pile of bag sprinkles in the bottom of my backpack. When I would wipe them away with water, it completely dissolved. 

From my understanding, the corn based ones are completely dissolvable - and this is what we use to clean litter boxes, corn trash bags for our kitchen cans, and clean our yard of dog poop (we have rocks, the pooper scoopers *do not work* without taking away all the rocks.) || My dog is little (under 20 lbs)and goes on pp pads.  I use 1 bag like a glove to pick up the poo poo and throw the poop into the toilet bc that‚Äôs the only way to handle feces properly.

We try to do ZW and doggie bags are one of the easiest to do because they're making compostables for it. || I read an article recently where someone said they slide a sheet of newspaper under their dog when it's about to poo. Not tried it myself but it's a thought... || I use the bags that contain bread or frozen fruit, etc. Like when I‚Äôm done w a bag of frozen berries, I‚Äôll rinse it w water that would‚Äôve gone down the drain as I‚Äôm doing dishes, let it dry overnight, then use it. This might be a pain but it honestly just takes me a minute so it‚Äôs not a fuss for me but if you‚Äôre someone who can‚Äôt be bothered w the process, use any other plastic bags that you happen to have.

Sometimes when I order stuff online it‚Äôll inevitably come w a plastic bag, or I‚Äôll find them incorrectly placed in the recycling bin in my building. Look around, they‚Äôre everywhere and I‚Äôm sure you can find some that would have been destined for trash even if you don‚Äôt use plastic yourself.

What can I do to Reuse Yellow Pad Papers with Written Notes in Ink (if i can)?,"**TL;DR**: I heavily depend on physically writing notes on paper. I end up with a lot yellow pad paper waste, any way I can reuse?

Hello! Sorry for the long post.

Information on the type of paper I heavily use: yellow pad paper of two types. One with a somehow glossy one and another with a rough paper ish feel.

I am a college student who heavily relies on physically writing things down, whether it be for studying, thinking, or journalling. So one can conclude I end up/will end up with a lot of paper waste at the end of every semester :((

I do try to use up as much space on the page as I can, and I am trying to be as concise with my notes. I also try taking notes digitally.

As much as I'd love to fully transition into digital note taking, physically writing things down helps me focus, keep track of information, and is what prefer overall. I am not sure if I can budget purchasing a tablet as a sort of substitute for physically writing things down, and I am not sure if it'll have the sort of same effect/feel I am accustomed to.

I just want to find a way where I can somehow reuse the amount of paper I consume :(( If I can't, I'll consider trying to give it away to a recycling center or a waste management one.

Additional question: should I reconsider the writing practice? Thoughts/experiences on the matter is greatly appreciated.","I personally use physical paper for a lot of writing and don‚Äôt feel super bad about it. I do have a tablet and other digital options but those have their own drawbacks like the effects of mining for materials used in electronics.

As far as what to do with the paper you already have used, recycling is probably the best option unless you have specific use cases in mind that would lend themselves to the materials:

- if the notes aren‚Äôt confidential, are they suitable for cutting up to make collages/art?
- can you turn the paper into pulp to make handmade recycled paper or paper mache?
- can you use shreds of it or dried pulp for bonfire/ campfire/fireplace starters? Or in a compost toilet if the ink is safe for that? || This is when REDUCE, REUSE AND RECYCLE comes into play: it is meant to be done *in that order*. 

Recycle/Reuse: You can absolutely use the non-coated paper in compost (along with food waste and other biodegradable matter). If your city has a green bin program you can look into that, if you wouldn't use compost yourself. If this is your chosen direction you could specifically look into purchasing, going forward, non-coated recycled paper (more easily biodegraded).

Reduce: if this practice truly bothers you enough, you can work at transitioning fully to digital notetaking. However I wouldn't let it take up too much stress in your brain since, and this isn't meant to be an attack whatsoever, I'm sure youre doing many other things that would be considered much more ""wasteful"" than these notes. Again, no shame here, it's baked into our lives.

If it were me, I'd go the compost route because I would actively use it in my garden/with my house plants and just be conscious about the paper I buy to make sure it's not coated. Maybe I would switch to pencil. 

I wouldn't consider this a hill to die/stress on but it's good that youre thinking about your habits from a waste lense! || Compost. || I like to make origami out of any and all papers.

However if you wanted to reduce the amount of paper, but don't want to commit to digital note taking, I would consider a reusable notebook like the Rocketbook (it has some plastic waste with the frixion pen refills though). || Do you use the back of the pages? 

I know when I use a yellow pad I typically don‚Äôt use the back bc of the way it folds over. 

But you can always cut up the notes like 4-6 sections per sheet and use the back as scratch paper around the house. 

And after that, unless you‚Äôre really into paper mach√© I‚Äôm not sure what else to suggest. || Absolutely considerate it writing practice. Don‚Äôt stop as it sounds like it‚Äôs working very well for you. I also prefer to physically write things down (that I need to remember, for example) over typing. Your handwriting is unique to you. And there is something very satisfying about putting pen to paper with purpose.¬†

I enjoy fountain pens a lot and that makes me want to physically write even more. I have many fountain pens, and I use them on a daily basis. However, I don‚Äôt have the budget or want to spend money for the more expensive papers that are popular in the FP community and I can‚Äôt bare to waste my ‚Äúgood paper‚Äù for scratch notes and to do/shopping lists‚Ä¶. So I use 20-24lb laser copy paper and print my own dots on both sides for my daily uses. (I like dot pads)

Have you ever tried ‚Äúcross writing‚Äù to save paper? That is where you fill the page with writing, then turn the page 90 degrees and continue to write‚Ä¶. Straight over the top of ¬† the prior writing. So you have a page of writing normally and then another whole page of writing on top of that writing, but perpendicular to it. Try it and you might find that the individual pages on top of each other aren‚Äôt as hard to read as you might imagine.

And as far as reusing the paper‚Ä¶ shredded or torn paper can be used in several ways. Compost, papier-m√¢ch√©, diy ‚Äúclay‚Äù (with a bit of white school glue), pet bedding, firestarter, as is or you can make firestarter cubes that you store for later‚Ä¶. Lots of creative uses for it. You could also cut it up into squares and try your hand at origami.¬†

We have four cats and a house rabbit. And we get grocery deliveries, which are usually dropped off in big sturdy fruit boxes that you get from the wholesale clubs. Some of the boxes we hold onto you because the fur kids love to lay and play in them.¬†

Every once in a while, we empty the paper shredder into one of those boxes and let them go ham digging. The rabbit loves it. Amd so do out two tom cats. It makes a mess, but it‚Äôs really easy to clean up and it‚Äôs so much fun watching them. You just have to be wary that you‚Äôre not putting credit cards and other things into your shredder that would not be good or could be sharp for them to dig in.¬† || Padding if you need to ship something!!¬† || How crafty are you?

Paper shredded can be recycled but also reused as packing material or not shredded but cut as papier-m√¢ch√© if you want to draw on top of your note taking. 

Don‚Äôt feel you have to change your note taking style. Memory is improved as thinking, vision and a physical action come together. || What I usually do is use the backside of the pages for rough work, to-do lists, or doodling before recycling them.

Once they‚Äôre completely filled, I make sure to collect them all for recycling, so at least they aren't ending up in the trash. || I keep a paper shredder under my desk and shred all uncoated paper/cardstock that I no longer use. This is going in my worm composting bin as bedding for the worms. A lot of people purchase peat moss or coco peat to use as the bedding and add their food scraps to compost them. I found that uncoated shredded paper and cardboard will serve just as well.

Space wise if you want to get into worm composting, you can do so with just a couple of 5 gallon buckets stacked up, which doesn't take too much space. Some people keep their worms indoors but I can't bring myself to do that as it increases the number of flies and gnats in the house if things get unbalanced.

Another use for some of my notebook paper is for quilting - I have used it for foundation paper piecing using small left over scraps of fabric.

How to reduce plastic waste in the retirement home where I work?,"I've been working in a retirement home for the past three months, where I clean dishes and prepare tables for lunch and dinner services. We serve up to 185 elders each day and we have a salad bar offering veggies and marinades during meals as well as snacks like bread and fruits between meals.

As you can see in the pictures, we use a lot of plastic. Bread and cereal bowls, among other things that elders can take to their apartments, must be covered in plastic wrap first (except for apples and bananas). We also have restaurant-like small spreading containers. The coffee brand we use comes in small plastic packagings. We open two of them for each filter and use about 4-5 filters each day (do the math). Veggies, marinades and salads are all put in small, single-use plastic cups, some of them not being recyclable. Now, I can understand the point of using plastic daily here :

1- It's cheap

2- It preserves freshness

3- It avoids extra dishes to clean (and we already have a lot!)

4- It gives light and reasonable portions for the elders

5- It takes very little space

BUT. Are there any alternatives I can propose to reduce the amount of plastic we use while keeping these five advantages? I love my job and I would appreciate to keep the elders happy with fresh food while giving a better example for other retirement homes in my region. You don't need to give suggestions for absolutely everything I mentioned, 'cause it is a lot of stuff, but I still appreciate some ideas you may have. Thanks in advance!","Not without additional washing which has to be able to sanitize (if they don't have a professional restaurant dish washer they'd need it), and additional staff to run the dishes through. Sanitary dishes is a big part of why they do this, because the elderly are extra vulnerable to viruses and bacteria. Things tend to go around in that setting. || Please do nothing that reduces the hygiene of the place. People will cough and sneeze onto open food containers. The fewer open foods, the better.

I feel that in hospitals and retirement homes, where you find a lot of people with compromised immune systems, other rules need to apply. || In these environments, laws have to be followed for the safety and hygiene of the residents. Also, many are running on a budget which excludes higher-priced, environmentally-friendly comparable products. Also, some places (not sure if the one you work at) work with people whose memory is diminishing or their dexterity is becoming limited. Keeping things sanitary is important, especially if those with memory issues don‚Äôt remember to wash their hands. 

While I appreciate your want to move to zero waste, I would suggest you find out why they operate the way they do before looking for solutions. I also don‚Äôt think 3 months is enough time to understand everything before deciding to change things. || Everything will need to stay the way it is because it's a retirement home, which means extra food safety. And that means plastic unfortunately.

Medical equipment and food safety are two of the areas where plastic is a necessary evil. || Yeah, this is kinda like asking for ways to reduce plastic waste in a hospital. If you've ever seen the amount of plastic waste that a hospital produces, it's almost fucking unbelievable. || For convenient single use things my gut would be ofc to switch to compostable paper products but that fights against the secret sixth thing: Durability. I can put something wet in a plastic container and it wont soak through.

That said, you might be able to make the argument for butchers paper/unbleached parchment for things like the sandwiches- just fold and seal with a sticker or tape if simply folding isn't enough. || I think plastic free in this workplace would be pretty hard to do since this is in place for sanitary/medical reasons.

Food waste might be something you can work on! I don't imagine everything gets eaten all of the time. It'd be cool to set up a compost on site and possibly a garden for the residents to enjoy. || I work in a university dining hall and we've started using commercially compostable plastic. All the compostable stuff has to be put in its own waste bin so it can be taken to a specific facility to be composted. Also I'm not sure but I'm going to assume the compostable plastic costs more than the regular stuff. || Honestly? As a facility planner who works on healthcare projects... Increase the time and wages of the people who work there. 

It's fairly easy to source more sustainable options for consumables. But the cost for that is increased time in the facility, dealing with the product/cleanup/waste etc.

P.s. this is not to suggest this isn't a great initiative! Just that the problem I anticipate is that health care/facility workers are consistently overworked and underpaid. And I think that life in care homes should be as relaxed as possible, and that starts with workers feeling supported and relaxed enough to not feel stressed about cleaning a French press or drip pot (as an example) || You have seemed to have forgotten about the 6th advantage of single use plastic containers: food safety.
There is a time and place to do our very best to reduce waste, retirement home and hospital are not one of them for the major part.
People can die if you are not careful in these environments.
Please, remember that. || I‚Äôm so glad to read through and see that others on this sub are coming at this with a level head. Protecting the residents from illness is the most important reason to use plastic for most of these things!

I worked in a hospital and seeing the amount of waste and plastic being used was painful - but it was purposeful waste because we were keeping patients safe from germs. Definitely, cut where you can (for me, it was requesting no plastic baggies sorting the supplies we got delivered every day) but know that it is not just for convenience sake that you use the single-use plastic.

Good on you for trying to help where you can! || Do you know if there is a plastic recycle company near you? The different kids of plastic (PET1, PP5, etc) would need to be sorted and clean(ish), but they might take them. I set my work up with a company that makes plastic deck boards and planters from recycled plastic. It‚Äôs a great partnership! || I've worked in a retirement community for almost 12 years. Covid is what started a lot of the single-use plastic. || My 90+yr old Grandmother with dementia lived with us for a while when I was a teenager; we had to keep a separate butter dish for her because she would lick the butter knife before getting more butter from the dish.  

I assume the retirement home is maximizing sanitary conditions for the residents given people get weird when they are old and age starts to dull their mind. || While not a completely zero waste solution, implementing systems to compost food waste could be a great step for your workplace to reduce its environmental impact! 

This would involve adding compost options where currently it‚Äôs just garbage, finding a place for that compost to go, and perhaps most importantly, educating folks about what can compost and what cannot. If your city does municipal compost, especially a curbside pickup option, then this is relatively low effort, which management always loves!

With such a system up and running, it would be much easier to make the case for compostable disposables over plastic. And in the meantime, you would be repurposing one of the greatest sources of greenhouse gases from garbage‚Äî wasted food. Good luck, and props to you for seeking solutions! || You don't. I work in a kitchen. It hurts, but it's not my place. || You can get waxed paper alternative for a lot of this applications BUT they will likely be more expensive, and not transparent, so you won't be able to see what you are picking up unless it is labelled (another production step)

I guess try to make sure the client's apartments have recycling containers and recycling training for your clients. || This is what plastic is for. At home I reuse plastic bags and use beeswax wraps and am an anti plastic zealot. At work I use as many single use plastic aprons, gloves and bags as needed. || The best way is to lobby your local government for a modern trash incinerator, that turns waste and plastic into energy/electricity.

Krak√≥w in Poland has built one, the air around it is cleaner than when households are burning wood or coal for heat  (a common sight in Poland).

https://khk.krakow.pl/en/eco-incinerator/

All trash will be turned into energy, in a relatively clean way. || Um, no. It‚Äôs necessary to be sanitary and food safe. Yeesh.

Bio-degradable cat litter,"What is the current word on bio-degradable cat litter?

I have five indoor cats and 36 acres.  So I'd rather just take the cat waste out into the forest and let it back into the soil rather than use clay litter and have to haul it to the dump.

But everything I find about bio-degradable litter always has some kind of drawback.  Pellets don't absorb and some cats don't like it.  Others don't clump, making removing urine impossible.

Any recommendations on this?","It's not a great idea to dump a lot of cat feces in the woods. Your cats are probably eating canned meat or kibble, which isn't part of the local woodland ecosystem. In other words, if you wouldn't put it in your compost (and you shouldn't), dumping it in the woods is also not great. 

I use unscented World's Best, which clumps very well and is made from corn chaff. It's much less dusty than clay litter and my cats and fosters all like it. It handles odors well. 

Clay litter is truly terrible environmentally. Not just because it's not biodegradable; it's also a product of strip-mining. Also, the dust can cause health issues for cats. 

My only complaint with World's Best is that it used to come in paper sacks but now comes in plastic ones. I hope they switch back. 

I've tried a bunch of other biodegradable litters made from wood shavings, paper, coconut fiber, etc. The only ones my cats absolutely rejected were the pine scented ones. || Cats carry toxoplasma which is spread through their feces and can be devastating to your local wildlife. You either need to put it through a proper composting situation with temps at 150 degrees or throw it away.
Edited spelling. || I always loved SmartCat - made from 100% grass - biodegradable, no gross fake fragrances, very lightweight, clumps well, fine soft texture that the kitties loved.  Best litter ever, in my opinion. || I like World's Best, it's made from corn and it clumps || Please please do not dump it in the forest. It is damaging to the ecosystem and belongs in the trash. || It‚Äôs sad but true that pet ownership comes with waste. || Pine pellets are the best. They are completely free of chemical agents and do an amazing job of absorbing odors. And it‚Äôs like $7 for \*40 pounds\* of it. || I use recycled paper pellet litter. No, it doesn‚Äôt clump, but I just scoop it out. Never got the whole clumping thing. || Okocat is great! They have a variety of texture options, control odor well, and most of their variants are clumping (I think the only one that isn‚Äôt is their paper-based one). || There‚Äôs lots of info out there about how car litter should not be composted. Definitely not the move || We use sWheat Scoop multi cat (I've never tried the others). It clumps urine well, and it's made from wheat. || swheat scoop can be flushed || [removed] || I use okokat clumping pellets right now. It's the lowest dust option I've tried, which is a high priority for my cat with asthma. It handles smells pretty well, though I have to switch litter after 4-6 weeks. It would compost ok.

World's best will probably compost better, it's pretty dusty and the clumps are not strong.

Nature's miracle is another tree-based option I haven't tested much (don't like the strong scent).

Feline pine is another good composting option. It doesn't clump but rather the pellets turn to dust when wet. You can dump the whole pan every 3-7 weeks, or sift the pellets from the dust and keep the pellets (reverse of the usual litter scooping). I have successfully composed this litter.

 I have heard of people using pellet litter from the farm supply store in the same way.

Paper litter should also compost well, but does not manage any of the smells.

There are concerns of spreading toxoplasmosis, but even if your cats caught toxoplasmosis they would only shed the parasite for two weeks after being infected and that's it. It's recommended to only use pet waste compost on non-food plants to minimize risks. || Feral cats aren‚Äôt natural, they‚Äôre actually invasive. Mountain lions are entirely different and are eating very different things than domesticated cats. You seem to just want to do it even though other people are telling you otherwise. I can‚Äôt stop you but it‚Äôs bad for the environment, full stop. || I just use wood shavings. || Feline Pine is my favorite as it is just sawdust. Several merchants will deliver it. You can get what's basically the same thing more and cheaper from feed stores as a generic, but you'll have to haul it yourself. || I‚Äôve been using a grass seed litter as of late I get from Petco. || Sounds like you‚Äôre looking for purrness.com || I recommend Breeder Celect-  made from paper.

From plastic bottles to reusable cups ‚Äî small but meaningful change at the Brussels 20K,"In 2022, runners at the Brussels 20 km were given tens & thousands of single-use plastic bottles by its sponsor SPA Water. This year, the organizers & sponsor SPA introduced reusable cups and more sustainable water packaging after endless campaigning. 

A small win ... but it matters. Reducing unnecessary single-use plastic at mass events is one way to cut' back on waste.

Facebook campaign Free Tap Water in Belgium advocates for accessible tap water and public fountains since 2019, encouraging events to move toward more sustainable models. It‚Äôs great to see momentum finally building.

Meanwhile, the Uccle 10K continues to set the standard:

‚úÖ reusable cups

I need to have stickers that label the product and ingredients, which means I‚Äôll need to have a variety of stickers. Most bakers use a home printer as it‚Äôs difficult to order that much variety, but I am struggling to find a lower waste option like compostable stickers. 

Has anyone found a solution or have any suggestions?","Tags. Use jute twine to seal the bag and unbleached card stock as the tag || Does it have to be stickers? I've seen some places use tie-on labels with recycled paper tags. But that's more common on things like canned goods where it's easy to tie something onto the jar. I have seen it on cookies too, where the tie on the tag is used to close the top of the bag. || Washi tape or double-sided biodegradable/compostable tape? || You can create custom stamps for your logo, name, common allergens if you want.

In my area we don‚Äôt have to label each baked good unless we are selling it basically as a prepackaged product.

For example I would sell cookies from a jar. I used mini chalkboards as the labels for chocolate chip or snickerdoodle. I would pack up the cookies in brown paper bags per customers‚Äô orders. I had all the allergy info separate.

Other areas make you have everything individually packaged and labeled with ingredients and allergies before selling. If you HAVE to do the individual packaging/labeling your hand is going to cramp writing that much. I would look for a 3rd party ecoprinting that you could order labels from.

Also, handwriting can be harder for some people to read. || There is a company out there that makes what they claim to be compostable blank label pages. In the end we just ended up writing in marker on the package, but we didn‚Äôt have to list ingredients so that‚Äôs a bit tougher.

Looking for RECYCLED metal jars for my small business!!,"Hello! I'm starting a business making lotions and my main priority is sustainability. Steel and tin are extremely recyclable, so I've been trying to find jars (small twist top jars) made from recycled steel or tin. But I just can't find a single source! I don't want to buy New jars, because I don't want to create any New waste (even though they are recyclable). My thought is, if they're so easy to recycle, why can't I find any? If anyone has any places that makes these or any ideas, I would appreciate it very much! Another option is just buying used jars and simply cleaning them myself, but I can't find a source for that either. So far, all I can find is small quantities for sale on ebay. Thank you!","I'm not sure what country you reside in, but if you search for screw top metal tins you'll find a whole bunch of wholesalers and manufacturers ask them for their blems (blemished) tins. As long as the screw top lid is secured properly they should be good to hold what you're filling them with. Price for a batch of blems is usually 20-30% less than those in perfect shape. If it's the manufacturer, it saves them time in sending those blems back for rework, and if it's a wholesaler, it saves them from having to toss less than pristine inventory or hold on to blems before they can send a full pallet or Gaylord back taking room in a warehouse. || To your question: My thought is, if they're so easy to recycle, why can't I find any?

Because most metal products probably contain at least partly recycled material, so they aren‚Äôt marketed as ‚Äúmade of recycled metal.‚Äù And when people are recycling metal containers they aren‚Äôt being cleaned and sent back out as-is, they are being melted down and recycled. || If it's recycled, you have to ask how is it recycled? curb-side pickup? it'll end with the other ferrous metals (catched by a magnet), melted and sold as recycled-metal to foundries to make new products. there won't be a triage before the smelters to reuse before recycling as it would cost more.

Follow the money.

you could buy new containers that are 100% recycled metal and ask for a deposit so your containers get brought back, but that's dependent on your clients.

Reusable Menstrual Pad,"Hi everyone, 

I am currently doing research regarding reusable menstrual pads. My research is about ""How Reusable Menstrual Products Support Girls‚Äô School Attendance in Eswatini"" For those who have use reusable pads, i was wondering if you can share your experience. Is it effective and cost-effective?

thank you","I prefer period underwear over reusable pads. Much more comfortable (in my opinion), and the care instructions are the same. Definitely cost effective, I will never go back to single-use products. || I purchased 10 reusable pads, a small waterproof bag for my purse, and 1 menstrual cup 15 years ago, all for the cost of two months of disposable products. I haven't had to buy a single period product since.

They are also way, way more comfortable than the disposables personally. || Yes and yes! Definitely cost effective, and super easy to manage, especially if you have access to a washing machine since you can just toss them in with a regular load. Even if not, a good hand wash does the trick. I would suggest looking into the different brands before purchasing, since they‚Äôre all a little different, but there are a lot of great options out there for reusable menstrual products. || Effective? Yes. It feels better than all the plastic, less hot, less irritation.

Cost effective? It's an investment at first, but over the years - definitely effective. || Yes to both counts. 
The initial cost other than disposables, but the more you use them the more cost effective they are. I have had mine for 5-6 years and only now are some of them becoming ineffective. || Definitely effective and has saved me sooo much money. I have 5 thick ones that have a fleece-like material on the side that touches skin and I have used them not only for periods, but also for post IUD insertion/removal. I have a friend who used hers right after she had a baby when she had bleeding a light incontinence issues. I also use reusable panty liners (have a water-proof lining) and they have been great during my light flows now that I have the IUD. I would never be able to afford to constantly buy pads and tampons off the shelf, so they have been lifesavers. 

I will say that I prefer using menstrual cups and menstrual discs (can be used during sex) because they last all day, but they are a pain to clean sometimes because they need to be boiled, which I can't do casually because social norms and comfort levels of family members matter in a similar way that I'm sure it matters among other cultures as well. The ease of just throwing them in the washing machine with my normal load or washing by hand  is wonderful. || I‚Äôve been using reusable pads I bought on Etsy for over 10 years so super cost effective! || I've only tried one brand of menstrual pads, which I bought a few years ago. I would assume there have been improvements since! Here's my experience.

I use them when I start spotting and while my period's tapering off, so 3-4 days/month. As long as it's not a heavy day, I don't have to worry about leaks. The ones I have hook around the underwear, and this is my biggest pet peeve with them. They slide quite a bit, and I have to adjust a few times during the day.

I rinse them out after each use, and put them in the washer once my cycle ends. They still look new. I'd say they're not only cost effective, but not having to worry about running out of pads/tampons is a bonus. I've been using menstrual cups/pads/underwear for almost a decade now, and I never think about switching back to disposable period products. The rinsing gets a little tedious, but not more than say, washing the dishes or taking care of other reusable products we have. || I don‚Äôt use reusable pads but I do use a menstrual cup and I love it! The only reason I‚Äôve had to buy more than one is because I‚Äôve misplaced mine or because I was traveling and started my period unexpectedly. 

The cup is quite easy to use when you figure it out, but can be messy. I try not to empty it unless I absolutely have to if I‚Äôm not home. I recommend it to anyone that will listen because it‚Äôs SO much more comfortable than tampons. || Sure! I have used cloth pads for over a decade. I personally trade between cloth pads, menstral cup and period underwear. Partly this is bc i have just one cloth pad left from my original set.

Cloth pads are awesome. They can be replicated with scrap material or upcycled. but idk if there are materials NOT to use? Maybe bc the female reproductive microbiome is sensitive (for some more than others) I think mine are cotton or a blend? 

...also periods vary so the # of pads needed per person could too. My habit of rinse, soak and washing the pad and day's unders with soap before bed and hanging to dry overnight helps.

Otherwise it means more pads are needed for the duration & then wash after period. They can be kept in an opaque laundry bag. Helps with privacy/modesty and is more sanitary.


Hope that helps üòÅ || I got on the bandwagon bc of a series of rashes I got from paper ones (I dislike tampons and I can‚Äôt currently use a cup/disk bc of my IUD) and I will legit never go back. They‚Äôre so much more comfy, the patterns are fun, they‚Äôre a really nice ‚Äústash‚Äù you keep during harder times (like for me the pandemic) and I‚Äôve had a few of them for nearly 8y that are still basically good as new to this day so they‚Äôre very long lasting. I think I spent a collective $150 or so across the entire collection over a few years, and that‚Äôs including fabric I used to make my own. I‚Äôm a heavy bleeder so I‚Äôd probably spend that much money on disposables in a year or two if I did my math right. 

They‚Äôre a bit more work technically bc of how I do them, but I don‚Äôt mind; I dry store mine (personal preference) so I need to soak and rinse them before washing but if you rinse before storage and add them to a load of towels you‚Äôre already gonna wash it‚Äôs no different than your normal wash day! || I have no advice regarding brands and stuff.  My only piece of advice is skip the chlorine bleach.  Use peroxide instead, the active ingredient in color safe bleach.  And don't wash in hot water because it will set in the blood stains.  If you do those two things, they should last longer. || I use menstrual cups which I personally find more convenient and the most secure period protection. It's also easier to wash than soaking saturated menstrual pads. Just dump it in the toilet and wash it with the bidet with a little bit of soap before reusing.

I back it up with cloth pantiliners, which are way more comfortable and secure than disposables. I've never had an accident. The blood washes off easily, but most of it is already caught by the menstrual cup.

I understand that menstrual cups aren't always culturally appropriate--I come from a culture that prizes virginity and many women believe that insertable feminine hygiene devices tamper with that. In which case, reusable pads are the way!

And bidets aren't common in the Anglophone world, I never got over that despite living ‚Öì of my life in the Anglosphere. So I just carry an empty water bottle with me wherever I go and use it as a portable bidet for period cleanup.

Ambulant toilets with a sink inside can be helpful for this, especially in places where de facto wheelchair traffic is low. || I‚Äôve been using cloth pads and period panties for about 14 years now. I just use the panties on light days and add the cloth pads on heavier days. They are absolutely cost effective. I was making cloth diapers and used scrap fabric to make pads when I started and then bought period panties. I‚Äôve easily saved thousands of dollars and it only would have been slightly less if I‚Äôd bought pads. I also have no more rashes from the plastics/adhesives of disposable pads, my periods are lighter in general, and my cramps are far less severe. || I prefer period underwear though I have tried reusable pads. For someone who wouldn‚Äôt bleed through a pad on a regular day, they are very helpful and cost effective. If you bleed a lot, it might be inconvenient to have a reusable pad out and about because you‚Äôd need a way to carry it home without it getting blood other places, stinking, or festering. As for cost, it‚Äôs 100% worth the initial investment for financial reasons and environmental reasons. || If anyone is interested, I have some I no longer need. Several brands, probably none still available. They are certainly used but washed appropriately. If wanted, I would wash again and mail them anywhere they are wanted. || I use reusable pads along with my menstrual disc. I can leak through the disk in 2 hours during my heaviest flow day, so the pad is good backup. I‚Äôve found reusable pads are not only more cost effective and lower waste, but also larger area, thinner yet way more absorbent, and best of all way more comfortable. Now the idea of using a disposable pad, sticky paper basically, weirds me out. I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell you how much disposable pads cost because I haven‚Äôt had to think about it in years. || I had very heavy periods when i had them. Reusable pads gave me a lot of security. I would wear the nighttime ones. Bulky as hell, but didn‚Äôt leak. || I loved them. Made my own with bamboo terry cloth, I have never not felt ‚Äúdamp‚Äù during my cycle due to how heavy they are but these pads made me feel so much better.¬†

Depends how waste free you want to go and heavy your cycles are. I sadly can‚Äôt go full waste free/biodegradable because my cycles are so heavy I need a waterproof layer but I still use them for many years before throwing them out. || I have menstrual pads and pants and would never go back to disposables. They‚Äôre comfortable, absorbent and wash well. The pants in particular are good at night time for heavy bleeders like me - no more bloody bedsheets, yippee!",39,ZeroWaste,2025-05-24 00:16:13,reusable menstrual pad,hi everyone currently research

Is letting it mellow still a thing?,"I'm an American (Northeast) who vacations in a rural area in Canada.  
We stay with a relative who insists on ""letting it mellow"", so much so that the ladies of the house put their toilet paper in a bin for #1s.  
I assume that standard septic can handle it. So, is it just a hold-over from old-timers? Or does it actually help your septic? I assume it's just less water in the system, so maybe that's a good thing from a water conservation standpoint.","I always considered ‚Äúlet it mellow‚Äù as more of a water saving practice than a septic issue. For the tissue into the bin, I feel like it‚Äôs more appealing to use a toilet not bogged down with 2-3-7 (how many mellows is acceptable?) used tissue. And while the septic might be able to handle it, I surely wouldn‚Äôt want to risk that much tissue when it came my turn to flush. || My best friend growing up lived in a farmhouse with an old septic system.

The family rule was- If it‚Äôs pee, let it be; If it‚Äôs brown, flush it down. Also limit toilet paper to poop. The bathroom constantly reeked of urine. One day, I forgot the rule and flushed after peeing, so they called my mom to pick me up immediately. || Mineral deposits can build up that discolour the toilet and may lead to ""pee-sicle"" clogs in the pipes, according to plumbers. || I used to do this as a water saving practice because I lived in California where there's always a drought. Turns out the uric acid crystals in urine wear down the coating on the toilet bowl making it harder to clean because it is pitted and not smooth, and you eventually need to replace it because it accumulates algae and slime molds quickly. || After thinking a bit more about this - assuming they are rural enough there‚Äôs no water service and they either have to haul their own from a well or rely on a rain catchment system, limiting flushing is way to extend your water supply. A toliet is like 1.5 gallons per flush, let‚Äôs say you house does 10 flushes a day, that‚Äôs a 105 gallons a week. that‚Äôs a lot of draw if you have a small tank. || As someone who sits to pee, NO! I want to be sustainable as much as the next diva, but sometimes our pee splashes back, and I don't want yours mixed in.

Exception is for midnight trips so the noise doesn't wake the household. || Hard to know for sure without asking‚Ä¶ but older septic systems did not always handle toilet paper great. I‚Äôve heard of one clog at the discharge of the main into the tank partly because toilet paper building up and freezing in really cold weather.

If they don‚Äôt even have a true septic system and use an old school wooden crib pit or a gravel bed style then you definitely want to limit whatever solids go down the tube if possible to extend the life of the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù. Same goes for the amount of water that goes down in a short period. The ground can only drain so much so quickly.

For folks using a straight up pit toilet/outhouse, there‚Äôs the urine diverting setups which are supposed to be less smelly and more environmentally friendly (no water needed so I guess that‚Äôs the most water efficient but not necessarily the best from a limiting contamination standpoint). || I let it mellow all night long. When I was pregnant I would wake up like 5x a night to pee, so I wouldn‚Äôt flush (or turn on the lights) so that I could stay in the ‚Äúsleep zone‚Äù and get back to sleep quicker. Now I don‚Äôt flush at night so as not to wake up the baby. || I mellow within reason. Unless I‚Äôm dehydrated or ate asparagus, I‚Äôll pee two or three times before I flush. Never had an issue with the toilet bowl discolouring. || I let it mellow.  We need all the water we can salvage || Not necessary anymore. We all used to have 5 gallon tanks. Now modern toilets get the job done in 1.5. Leaving TP in there for multiple visits could clog it. Also, who needs to smell that, seriously... || Yeah it's for sure still a thing.
I'm not well versed in septic tanks, but I imagine that less toilet paper and flushing overall is still helpful for standard septics. It seems like it would extend the amount of time before it needs to be cleaned out, and possibly extend the overall life span of the tank?

It's very helpful from a water conservation standpoint though, especially if you don't have one of those fancy eco-friendly toilets. We do it in my house even though we're on city water just because it helps with the bills a little bit. || At our cabin we practice the ‚Äúmellow‚Äù rule because we have a septic holding tank, and don‚Äôt want it to fill up too quick with all the extra flushes. 

We get it pumped more frequently now than we used to, but it‚Äôs just a habit at this point. || Not flushing toilet paper down the Septic also has to do with saving space! Sure the septic tank could handle it BUT why bother filling it up with paper. Having your septic tank emptied less is a absolutely better for the environment than filling it with paper unnecessarily. We are talking YEARS of extra use. || I let it mellow when it's a bad year for the water well. Been a few years of some spots having droughts so wouldn't be surprised if there's lots of mellowers around. || It depends. 

As others have mentioned, leaving it mellow for too long ultimately results in extra scrubbing and premature toilet replacement.

From a septic tank and well water perspective, it's likely to be a necessity to some degree. 

Less flushing equates to less water usage and if you're entirely dependent on the well, this is critical, particularly when facing drought conditions. 

Similarly, for the septic tank, if the tank is due to be pumped, is experiencing failure in any way, or is just too small to accommodate extra usage (for example, multiple extra guests - especially those who only know 'city water' or are staying for several days) it can back up into the yard, so it's good practice to reduce the flow.

The key is balancing the mellow time against the well /septic stressors to maximize water availability and toilet life while minimizing septic stress, toilet stink and scrubbing. || I live in France and let it mellow if I go for a wee during the night to avoid possibly waking up my partner with toilet flush sounds. If I have a dump, it's obviously flushed. || Nasty, especially if you‚Äôve all eaten asparagus. Wanna save water? Pee outside. || I've never had a septic system. I let it mellow because I don't like to waste water and because I'm getting older and pee more frequently. || I imagine if you are in a area that has water rationing orders in place it‚Äôs very much still a thing",220,ZeroWaste,2025-05-23 07:07:22,letting mellow still thing,american northeast vacations rural area canada stay relative insists letting mellow much ladies house put toilet paper bin assume standard septic handle hold old timers actually help septic assume less water system maybe good thing water conservation standpoint,always considered let mellow water saving practice septic issue tissue bin feel like appealing use toilet bogged many mellows acceptable used tissue septic might able handle surely want risk much tissue came turn flush best friend growing lived farmhouse old septic system family rule pee let brown flush also limit toilet paper poop bathroom constantly reeked urine one day forgot rule flushed peeing called mom pick immediately mineral deposits build discolour toilet may lead pee sicle clogs pipes according plumbers used water saving practice lived california always drought turns uric acid crystals urine wear coating toilet bowl making harder clean pitted smooth eventually need replace accumulates algae slime molds quickly thinking bit assuming rural enough water service either haul well rely rain catchment system limiting flushing way extend water supply toliet like gallons per flush let say house flushes day gallons week lot draw small tank someone sits pee want sustainable much next diva sometimes pee splashes back want mixed exception midnight trips noise wake household hard know sure without asking older septic systems always handle toilet paper great heard one clog discharge main tank partly toilet paper building freezing really cold weather even true septic system use old school wooden crib pit gravel bed style definitely want limit whatever solids go tube possible extend life system goes amount water goes short period ground drain much quickly folks using straight pit toilet outhouse urine diverting setups supposed less smelly environmentally friendly water needed guess water efficient necessarily best limiting contamination standpoint let mellow night long pregnant would wake like x night pee flush turn lights could stay sleep zone get back sleep quicker flush night wake baby mellow within reason unless dehydrated ate asparagus pee two three times flush never issue toilet bowl discolouring let mellow need water salvage necessary anymore used gallon tanks modern toilets get job done leaving tp multiple visits could clog also needs smell seriously yeah sure still thing well versed septic tanks imagine less toilet paper flushing overall still helpful standard septics seems like would extend amount time needs cleaned possibly extend overall life span tank helpful water conservation standpoint though especially one fancy eco friendly toilets house even though city water helps bills little bit cabin practice mellow rule septic holding tank want fill quick extra flushes get pumped frequently used habit point flushing toilet paper septic also saving space sure septic tank could handle bother filling paper septic tank emptied less absolutely better environment filling paper unnecessarily talking years extra use let mellow bad year water well years spots droughts surprised lots mellowers around depends others mentioned leaving mellow long ultimately results extra scrubbing premature toilet replacement septic tank well water perspective likely necessity degree less flushing equates less water usage entirely dependent well critical particularly facing drought conditions similarly septic tank tank due pumped experiencing failure way small accommodate extra usage example multiple extra guests especially know city water staying several days back yard good practice reduce flow key balancing mellow time well septic stressors maximize water availability toilet life minimizing septic stress toilet stink scrubbing live france let mellow go wee night avoid possibly waking partner toilet flush sounds dump obviously flushed nasty especially eaten asparagus wanna save water pee outside never septic system let mellow like waste water getting older pee frequently imagine area water rationing orders place much still thing

Misfits market vs grocery stores,"I'm 18 years old and I live with my family (though I‚Äôm soon going to college for environmental science). I am vegan solely for the animals, but l'd be lying if I said that environmental concerns don't play a role in my dietary habits. I'm an avid environmentalist, I want to lessen my impact.

My mom has been letting me get stuff off of misfits markets because I tout the ""rejected"" produce/ unsold stuff to her, on top of occasional discounts for more sustainable products that are cheaper.
Recently l've been thinking of all the ice packets, cardboard boxes, potential plane flights/travel, and products that definitely weren't rejected from grocery markets (bread, produce, tofu, tempeh) because only SOME the stuff on there is marked
""packaging mistake"" or ""slightly large/small"", or ""rescued""

I try to go to my local farmers market as much as possible for all produce, shop small as much as possible, and for goods such as grains, cereals, nuts, beans, legumes, and granola, I go to Sprouts. But for the stuff that I can't get locally, say, bananas, pineapple, oranges, and packaged items such as tofu, tempeh, impossible meat, and whole wheat bread/other more processed options... should I stop using misfits and just go to the regular grocery stores, picking out the misfit fruit myself (individual bananas, bruised apples, etc.) and buy the tofu, tempeh, and packaged goods there instead??

TLDR: Do I stop using misfits market and just go to Sprouts? I feel like they both have negative impacts (Sprouts only showing the best fruit they have at higher prices/being a bigger chain, and misfits having a more visible footprint)","Hello!

Dish washer or Hand wash?,"Which one is less waste? I‚Äôve heard Dishwashers waste less water and if I go to a refill area and just buy the pods I feel like that isn‚Äôt bad. Or should I hand wash  and use a safe and clean bar soap or one of those soap dishes or soap squares? 
","Dishwasher is way more efficient. And more effective when used correctly. || dishwasher when running full load, easily. especially if you can find an ‚ÄúEnergy Star‚Äù sticker anywhere on it. 

don‚Äôt use pods. the coating they use breaks down into microplastics.  

Dirty Labs makes great dishwashing powder. (and laundry detergent) || It is *possible* to hand wash as efficiently as a machine but it's a weird and laborious and somewhat gross process.  You don't get to just dilute away all the muck to a comfortable degree.  You're going to be knuckles-deep in hot soapy food slurry. || This is easily google-able and it's dishwasher hands-down || Are we considering the lifespan of the dishwasher? It‚Äôs an awful lot to manufacture and dispose of vs a sink and wash cloths, scourers that you have anyway?

I suspect a lot of the dishwasher vs hand washing claims are based off washing under running water. If you partially fill your sink (and not one of the ginormous butler‚Äôs sinks) with water and take a tactical approach to washing cleanest to dirtiest, it doesn‚Äôt use a vastly different amount of water. Hand washing does use a lot less electricity though, particularly when a drying cycle is factored in and if you are pre-rinsing. In either case if you serve a little less food and finish the meal with bread to wipe off the plates they start the process cleaner. 

Depending on where you live water might be a very precious resource with high environmental value or electricity consumption might be the priority (if for example you don‚Äôt have solar production and live in an area where the electricity network relies heavily on burning fossil fuels). 

I have a dishwasher and appreciate it, mostly because I lived for 4 years with two kids without one first. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the better environmental choice though. It‚Äôs convenient.  It‚Äôs also a big lump of plastic and metals that will end up in landfill. I do kind of miss the conversations while my husband washed and I dried while our babies slept though, those were wholesome moments. || We‚Äôre in southern CA, and we have a new, efficient dishwasher. We will lightly handwash things that might have too much grime for the dishwasher (dried oatmeal on a pot, coffee grounds, sourdough starter), and use a bin to soak/collect water from these and the items we can‚Äôt wash in the dishwasher. We use the water outside to water trees on the curb and parts of our lawn. It‚Äôs worked well for a few years so far and we avoid having plumbing issues (or needing to snake the pipes more) from grime. || Dishwasher, if it's a newer model that's efficient. I don't use pods for dishwasher or laundry, because it's almost always more than is necessary. I've been happy with Seventh Generation powder dishwasher detergent for ages. It's in a paperboard box.¬† || I know they say dishwashers are more efficient, but I think that relies on not pre rinsing your dishes.¬†

Idk maybe I‚Äôm not trusting enough, but I still give my dishes a quick rinse to remove food remnants, sauces, etc. before putting it in my dishwasher.

How did you reduce the amount of landfill waste,"Did you notice a reduction in your landfill waste? I think I still average about 2 tall kitchen bags of landfill waste, even though I switched to many green alternatives. 

Or do you count recycle + landfill? What were the biggest changes that made a difference? 

I do use all of the .. shampoo bars, soap bars, CSA for veggies, but the trash can is still full of: 

- delivery food containers (we order once or twice a week, when we run out of meal prepped meals)
- snack bags (nuts, cookies, granola, sometimes chips, paper wrappers that can‚Äôt go to recycling, etc). I can make some of them at home, but not always, because I meal prep all our meals and that takes me 5+ hours a week already. 
- bagged stuff for cooking (grain bags, pre-packaged food plastics and some containers, like from sausages or cheeses). 

Also, how do you collect your trash in other rooms? Kitchen had recycling, but bathrooms end up collecting mixed trash (some compostable, some not). Do you sort the trash from those places later? 

Also.. can I put my vacuum trash or lint from laundry in compost or not? For the vacuum it‚Äôs mostly dog hair, so should be compostable, but also.. there is dirt? Not sure. And for laundry lint, it‚Äôs also mostly dog hair, but how do I know it‚Äôs not microplastic that‚Äôd be bad for their plants? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ","We do one 13 gallon kitchen bag a week for two people.  


- Compost: whether through a service like Mill or in a traditional back yard setup is the biggest change most people can make
- Learn your local recycling rules. I can‚Äôt recycle the entire can from Bar Keepers Friend, but I can cut the top and bottom off and recycle them. Film plastic is separated (they take it curbside here, when in a clear plastic bag, but most grocery stores take it, even if they don‚Äôt recycle I would rather they pay to dispose). Batteries, scrap metal, etc have collection containers in the house that are recycled when full.
- Reuse & donate stuff. The stained towels are now rags, these get recycled when they start to fall apart. Other items are donated or put on the curb for people who want it. (Retail display, often with notes an during our city‚Äôs ‚Äúbig trash week‚Äù, our pile is often just rotten lumber that the city won‚Äôt take any other way by the time pickup occurs). Unlabeled #5 plastic (takeout, but some packaged food) gets washed in the dishwasher (no heat, or top rack) on turned into holiday cookies containers. Produce bags become pet waste bags.
- Buy with recycling in mind. I avoid glass beer bottles and get aluminum ones as the glass is expensive to transport and thus rarely recycled, aluminum is easy to recycle. Same for tomato sauce, canned in better quality (no light) and steel is easy to recycle. Powdered dish detergent is lighter, cheaper, and tho cardboard boxes are more likely to be recycled than plastic bottles. But film plastic on frozen foods are easier to recycle than waxed cardboard. Buy frequently used consumables in bulk and decant into reusable containers, if you have the room. || Take-out packaging is definitely the biggest culprit, I bet. I never get delivery (I‚Äôm too cheap to pay the fees), but I eat inside a restaurant 1-2x/week. I still eat meat and use conventional oral & body care, but I‚Äôd wager I consume less than the average American (ie. 2lb of meat/week, pea-sized dot of toothpaste, quarter-size pump of shampoo/conditioner washing my long hair 2-3x/week). I generate a grocery bag‚Äôs worth of landfill per week, which is 90% food packaging from Aldi. All organic matter (~half of a grocery bag) go to a compost service. || I'll just give the /r/composting response: 

It's sort of up to you whether your compost your vacuum/laundry waste. What do they consist of? Unless your clothes are strictly natural fibers, then your laundry waste is probably full of synthetics that you don't want in your compost. Likewise with the vacuum waste, though if you say it's mostly dig hair, then that's of course fine for the compost (aside from any medications that may be present).  
  
To go back to your wider question: I do plenty of things in my home to reduce waste, but I've started going beyond that in composting food waste from a nearby restaurant and grounds from a coffee shop. This is of course not for everyone, though. I have the infrastructure to scale up my composting operation (primarily that people drop their leaves off at my place in the fall so I have plenty of ""browns"" to be able to compost all of the kitchen waste) *and* I drive by the restaurant and coffee shop daily when I drop my son off at school anyway. But if you're generally looking to reduce waste and have run out of things you personally can cut out, expanding to other people's waste is one way to make a difference. || I try to buy a lot of things in bulk that I can use reusable containers for. Consider this for things like nuts and granola that you eat frequently. My pantry is full of jars of various nuts/seeds, granola, dried fruits, etc. If you keep a variety on hand it is easy to switch it up and make different snack mixes. Most of these things are shelf stable for 6+ months and I just refill them as they are depleted. 

I also keep a lot of common cooking ingredients like grains and beans that I buy in bulk (rice, quinoa, pearl barley, oats, black beans, lentils, etc). Additionally I eat a plant-based diet which makes it easy for me to base most of my food around things that do not require packaging, and has a significantly lower impact on the production side of things as well. I mostly shop for fresh fruit and vegetables that I can combine with all the staple foods and spices that I keep in bulk at home to make my meals every week. 

Basically take a look at all the stuff you are finding has the most waste and ask yourself if there are feasible alternatives. At least for me, finding a lot of the things that you listed in bulk is easy. 

Also no to your question about vacuum trash or laundry lint. These are going to have a lot of plastics in them and other nasty things from carpet, the stuff you track into your house on your shoes, polyester in your clothing, etc. || We (limited pescatarian) don‚Äôt do take out or delivery, food waste goes into the biodigester, compostable items go in compost, we have about two kitchen sized bags of landfill trash a month if that, we take recycling to transfer station every month or so (we have recycling bins) garden waste goes into compost/biodigester depending 

We also buy in bulk and vacuum seal using reusable bags, then freeze (trying to talk him into a freeze dryer) or place in dry storage || Can you reuse the delivery food containers as Tupperware or use them instead of Ziploc bags when you give things away?

Sometimes you can reuse plastic bags with zips if you clean them out as ziploc bags. But depending on the product that can be a lot of work. || [removed] || I eat mainly 'whole foods', i.e. not much processed food. Eg: salad or pasta with some veggies and seasoning. So there's less waste. And I shop in a local shop where I can bring my own containers to refill, e.g. flour, sugar, pasta, herbs, nuts, raisins, dried beans, rice, popcorn. I get most of my groceries there.

Then I grow a good bit of my own food, and preserve it in glass jars. 

It takes me about a month to accumulate one standard sized plastic grocery bag of landfill trash. One person. || Depending on the location and country in general that you live in, soft plastics like snack wrappers can be collected somewhere in your house and when you have enough of them, take them with you on your next grocery run and recycle them in store if they participate (Lived in both UK and Aus and both countries have this). Similarly, you could look to see if there are any bulk stores near you where you can get grains, avoiding the grain bags. 

If you cant do any of this, it might just be time to accept that you have reduced your own waste footprint as much as you feasibly can at your current time in life. You do not have to do zero-waste perfectly, even a minor reduction in waste from one million people has a significantly larger impact than one person reducing their waste entirely. Just the fact that you care, and are making a conscious effort to do what you can is enough. || Unless you only wash 100% natural materials I wouldn't compost dryer lint. It will contain a lot of micro plastics. Same goes for vacuum waste.

I only have a small bin of rest waste every couple months, which is incinirated here. That is mainly because I can seperate eveything else. My main waste output is PMD plastic, metal, drinkcartons. Of which I fill a trashbag every four to five weeks on my own.

I keep my rest waste bin in the bathroom because that's where I use it most. Mainly to clean my hairbrush. I line it with toilet paper packaging. I barely order out max once a month. I use a menstrual cup so there isn't any menstrual waste in there.

Just not buying unnecessary things saves a lot of packaging too. I mainly drink tea and water so I don't have bottles in the trash. Although those have a deposit system here. I don't use kitchen paper or aluminium foil either.

For snacks, buy the biggest possible/useful packaging.

To prevent take out. You can buy full meals to put in the freezer. Also do you have to do all the cooking? Can't your partner or your kids do some of it? Seems like you cook for five days and then have two days left which is just too much. Why not make one of those days your partner's cooking day and the other your kids' cooking day. || We do one 13 gallon kitchen bag a week for 3 people. 

We have small trash cans in each bathroom and office, with no plastic bag liners. That gets dumped directly into our large garage trash can before being taken out for pick up each week. There isn‚Äôt usually much trash in those though. Mostly used tissues, bandaids and such.

We compost all our veggies food scraps; recycle all metal, #1 and #2 plastic, glass, white and brown paper, and corrugated cardboard. 

I try to buy in bulk which sometimes cuts down on waste. 

We only get take out once a month. I often try to make double batches of meals when I cook and freeze the extra so we turn to that food instead of take out when I don‚Äôt feel like cooking.

We wash and reuse plastic bags as much as possible; use rags instead of paper towels, and cloth napkins instead of paper napkins. 

Maybe we don‚Äôt buy as many packaged snacks? Not sure what else to suggest || I‚Äôve reduced a lot of non-recyclables too, but now most of my trash is plastic from food and detergent. I try to buy bigger detergent containers and avoid plastic on produce as much as possible, but it still adds up. Feels like there's only so much you can control when so much food is packaged.

I don't have trash around my home but just in the kitchen. They organic and glass it's outside. If you have more trash in other rooms you don't recycle correctly so this is why I avoid it. || When we ordered an asian delivery meal, they provided low-quality chopsticks. We didn't need those because we had better ones at home. It happened a few times, we threw them away but it didn't sit right with me. So I contacted the restaurant and suggested they make a checkbox on their website, so customers can specify if they want those chopsticks or not. They listened and did this! So many businesses are not aware of these things and when you ask nicely, who knows what changes can be made for a better environment. || Compost. Bulk aisle. || I use Www.Ridwell.com for plastic film, double layer plastic and a rotating bag for various items. A Lomi and worm bin for compost, and the landfill box || We live on our farm, two households. We bought the smallest bin possible and share one tiny bin between two houses. We live out in the sticks, and it's a real hassle to get rid of garbage at the municipal facilities that are far away.

Works wonders. We all think twice before we buy. It makes ""convenience"" ()e.g., take out containers, snack packs) really inconvenient. || Vegan, no delivery(but roommates etc do), I do home compost. 

Any HEAVY, or large plastic has to goes down every 2+ months, it goes in a cardboard box for these large plastics that should stack together etc because they will fill the bags fast. 

natto styrofoam, and soy milk cartons are currently the biggest atm. Besides that it is flat plastic. I get the 1x2 rectangular but the 2x2 square bottom plant milk i would razor blade diagonally and then put it in a plastic bread bag before putting into the trash can. I have a plastic bread bag for all small plastic or metal that touched food+wont be composted or I‚Äôm worried will poke the bag. 

tortilla or bread plastic bags help, those are generally my most calorie dense food i by for the $ and time it takes to prepare.

Paper-towel or toilet paper roles should go immediately to compost instead of ever touching bathroom trash 

I have a trash bag with a year or two of vaccum dust and hair-no pets it‚Äôs like maybe half full, there‚Äôs no reason to try to try and recycle vaccum waste unless you are vacuuming the highway or a mine || Our towns recycling center was hit by a tornado and destroyed so now all recycling is being taken to the landfill.  ive started taking a couple bags to my parents place to recycle a couple hours away every other weekend. || We have a large outdoor bin. We take that once every 2-3 weeks. It gets filled mostly from emptying the cat box. We are a household of 2 adults and 3 fur babies. I will eco brick most plastic packaging. If the packaging is gross from food then it goes in a plastic grocery bag or large previous food bag (like frozen fruit or veggie bag) in the freezer. That goes in the big bin when it's full. It takes me a good while to fill a plastic bottle for the eco bricking. I mostly use old vinegar bottles for the eco brick. As far as non-meat food waste, we compost it. We also have a friend down the road with pigs and can give them old food scraps. All cardboard and paper gets burned. I am very mindful of the packaging when I purchase something. I will spend more money on an item that comes in glass, metal, or cardboard as opposed to plastic. I reuse the glass containers for dry food storage, canning - I look for items in mason jars, or for beverages. We don't get to go food very often. We live in a small town of less than 1000 people.

Food packaging,"I‚Äôm wondering how to cut down on food packaging waste? With foods like chips, cheese, or lots of frozen products, it all seems to come in plastic and I‚Äôm looking for some tips!","The only way I have found consistently to avoid as much food packaging waste as possible is I never eat out, and I make everything from scratch. If you buy Frozen stuff you could have just as easily made it from scratch. Try to buy in bulk. I prioritizing buying things in glass so that I can reuse it. || Love of Earth Co. has some videos on zero waste grocery shopping that might be helpful.

Just know plastic is what allows a lot of items to be convenient. So if you‚Äôre looking for zero waste *and* convenience you may not find it.

For example, chips are in plastic/aluminum now because it‚Äôs convenient. It does a lot better of a job keeping chips fresh and intact than its predecessors (barrels, tins, waxed paper bags). So if you want to eat chips but want it to be zero waste, you need to remove the element of convenience and make the chips yourself. 

Same goes for frozen vegetables. You‚Äôd have to buy in bulk and freeze yourself if you need them to be frozen. If not you can opt for canned versions. I find for most recipes there is no difference between the two. 

Unless you have a cheese counter/monger at your grocery store, you probably won‚Äôt find cheese without plastic packaging. I‚Äôve been able to get my cheese wrapped in paper and use my own packaging, but only because there‚Äôs an international cheese selection that a monger will cut for you at my local grocery chain. || Homemade popcorn, there are no chips etc in sustainable packaging that I've ever seen. || The spirit is: Buy in bulk and store in a way that keeps the food good.

E.g: Chips (crisps) will be almost impossible to get without a bag. They would just get stale too quickly. We buy what our supermarket sells as a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù size but put out individual servings into a little bowl for eating. (As opposed to buying individually packaged servings) We use clips that close the bag airtight. That way one bag stays good for about a week.

You can buy a big block of cheese, grate it yourself and then freeze.

I will NOT give up on frozen food, because it comes in plastic packaging. Especially frozen vegetable mixes are such an affordable, accessible, low mental effort way to add veggies into my diet. Do not compromise your health and your diet in an effort to lower your waste!

I do not have the mental energy, time and freezer space to freeze all of my own foods. To me frozen food is an alternative to eating out or ordering food/takeout which causes way more waste than a single food package.

If you don‚Äôt end up using the fresh produce you brought and it goes bad, its less sustainable than buying the frozen stuff in a plastic bag. || Ive accepted that I‚Äôll always have leftovers and now freeze the leftovers into my lunches for work. || I take a look at what prepackaged products I enjoy the most and then learn how to make them - for me that‚Äôs: kombuchas, flax crackers, aged cashew cheeses, ‚ìã cheese products, breads and all fermented foods.  Depending on where you live there may be container-free stores nearby?  We have oodles where I‚Äôm from and some carry the cornucopia of junk foods (you name it: sugar cereals, pretzels, jelly beans, chips of all kinds) and some are more useful to me with nuts, flours, ingredients to make your soap, body care. || If it existed you'd already know. You have to cook more fresh things, eat less packaged stuff. If you want frozen food freeze it yourself. || I buy at local store where I can bring my jars and containers and fill them up. So cool not to be dealing with all the extra waste. Also, all my stuff is super fresh because I just buy what I need. E.g. I have a flour jar, and I just fill it when I need flour. I bring in my salt and pepper shakers and fill them. Most of my shopping is there. But as others have pointed out, chips are hard. I use popcorn kernels from the bulk store, using my container. If I'm feeling really ambitious, it's not too difficult to make tortilla chips from tortillas. Good luck! || Buy the largest block of cheese you can.  I buy the big Tillamook blocks.  Use to make your own shredded cheese.  Cut in half or quarter and wrap well in something like a beeswax wrap to preserve for later. || A bunch of thoughts!

I find this problem gets easier when you focus on one item at a time - I do an ‚Äúaudit‚Äù of my trash every once in a while to find the biggest contributors. This inspired me to cut out takeout and frozen meals - I freeze leftovers in meal size portions and get ‚Äúfamily size‚Äù frozen meals for when I don‚Äôt feel like cooking for multiple days in a row

You may have a zero waste or bulk grocery near you that has some items available - like trail mix, sweets, and some snacks - it‚Äôs imperfect but it may fill some gaps

You can use old chip bags as trash bags or doggie bags.

I reuse the little plastic produce bags or just don‚Äôt bag my produce for some things

See if you have a ‚Äúdiscount grocery‚Äù store near you. These places often sell expired and overstock for cheaper, it‚Äôs imperfect as well since you still throw out the stuff in the end but it‚Äôs slightly less impact.

Also see if you have a ‚Äúrestaurant wholesale‚Äù place where you can buy in bulk sizes.

If you are not able to make literally everything from scratch or pay a fortune - it‚Äôs basically impossible to eliminate food packaging waste and maintain the quality of life you‚Äôre used to - but with this I‚Äôve cut about half of my trash || 1/ I started freezing my own food: I buy them fresh. Then, depending on the food, I chop and freeze; or blanch, chop and freeze. It‚Äôs super easy, and I actually enjoy it because I can chop the food exactly how I like.

2/ For cheese and deli items, bring your own container to the store and ask the person behind the counter to put it directly in there. Most places are happy to help!

3/ For snacks, bring your own container when possible. If snacks don‚Äôt come loose, try buying them in bulk and portioning them out yourself at home. || You could get bulk snacks from a co-op - bring your own reusable containers.

Flossing - Zero Waste,"Had to share this to y'all:

I personally hate flossing only with a string. The only sustainable way for me to pick up the habit was to use plastic flossing  picks but I was always self-conscious about the single use plastic I was tossing away.
I just discovered this a couple weeks ago and I love it! Get some string tie it around and voil√† you got your floss device. Once you're done. Just clean the tool and dispose of the floss string!

Anyone else using a floss handle? ‚úã 
","What‚Äôs this called; I have a Quip reusable flosser handle I got as a gift but frankly it sucks and I feel like this one will work better lol || I use a floss handle. My mouth doesn't open very wide so it's helpful for getting my back teeth. Game changer for dental health. Used to have 4s back there and now it's 2s &3s. || Nice! I use a water flosser and love it. My dentist says ‚ÄúI just care that you floss, doesn‚Äôt matter what gets you to do it.‚Äù || Omg. I am so glad I saw this. I have been using a floss holder that Listerine made that you had to buy refill packs of floss strung onto a plastic thing that clipped into the holder, but it works so well, I was loathe to give it up. I can't with just floss, and I hate those plastic pick thingies. This can replace what I'm using now with so much less waste. || Where do you get this? I hate the single use but I would actually use this || I've been using a similar product for years...

...but recently they've started to break a lot easier than they used to. Last time one broke the first week I used it, so the company sent me a new three-pack and said they had recently switched factories and were working to get the standards back up to snuff.

I love it to scrub the gaps between my teeth (not a replacement for flossing), it's made my dental visits better. I wash mine in the dishwasher, and there's also replacement brush heads once those get worn. || I  started using this when my kid was 2 or 3. He's 6, and we're still using the same one. It might last until he can floss without a holder :)

For floss, we use bamboo charcoal one from the Me Mother Earth store. I have a metal case. It also lasts forever. || I‚Äôve been using these for years! Super easy to use and they last a really long time (if you‚Äôre careful not to break them).

You‚Äôll want to use good quality floss so it wont tear while you‚Äôre using it. When setting up the floss and tying it secure, you want to make sure it‚Äôs taut, but not too much so for maximum comfort and effectiveness. 

Spools of floss with zero waste packaging are pretty easy to find online and pretty cost-effective, and I also found a little reusable cylindrical metal floss container I use to easily snap off floss to the desired length.

Plastic contact lens case - reuse or recycling?,"I‚Äôm a monthly contact lens wearer so have a few hard plastic contact lens cases that my lenses get stored in overnight.

At a recent eye exam, my optician asked how often I replace them, and I told him never and that I just soak them in boiling water once a month. He did not like this and told me how it‚Äôs quite dangerous due to the bacteria in tap water than don‚Äôt die even in boiling water.

I can find lots of information online about contact lens recycling for the lenses themselves as well as the packaging they come in (which I already recycle at my optician‚Äôs) but really little info on whether the hard plastic reusable cases are recyclable.

If they aren‚Äôt, I‚Äôll probably just keep doing my method and take the risk tbh because I really don‚Äôt like the thought of sending them to landfill as a very regular contact wearer.

UK based.","Please do *not* take the risk. There are some pathogens you really don‚Äôt want near your eyes which can cause you to go blind. This is essentially a health concern, which isn‚Äôt primarily where zero waste efforts are focused. 

I think there are metal cases which you can sterilise with greater ease. || i saw someone on youtube use them to bring small amounts of shampoo/conditioner/lotion/handcream etc! maybe they could also work for meds? or anything tiny you want to keep in your purse. like small earrings or paperclips. || To me these are considered a medical device and I think plastic waste with medical items is ok. You could likely get metal cases but I would ask your the doctor how to clean those. I have a few of these and I use them for travel.

Would ditto other comments in saying health is more important than zero waste!

Plastic and Cardboard,"I have been working toward a more sustainable life, I save scraps for veggie and meat stocks, I put grounds on the plants in the yard, I mend clothing where I can, I try to run at least a semi sustainable ship here. We don‚Äôt have a composter but are looking into starting one up in the future. And I‚Äôm not interested in letting perfect be the enemy of good. But what the heck do I do with all the plastic? I haven‚Äôt been able to come up with anything regarding it. Eco bricks seem fine I guess but there‚Äôs no dropoff near me, and it feels like it doesn‚Äôt accomplish all that much. I don‚Äôt knit or crochet and don‚Äôt have time to learn (full time work, toddler, pets, etc.), so those bags made of bags are out, 

What do you all do with the somewhat unavoidable never ending plastic mountain? I recycle it but that never feels solid enough. ","For the most part, the trick is to keep it from coming into the house as much as possible. It's never a perfect solution (some things just aren't available without some plastic, and if you take medications or have other needs, there will be plastic associated with that) but there is a LOT of plastic that's rather easy to avoid, which will reduce the amount you have to manage. || I prioritise plastic-free items, like loose produce, as much as I can.


A lot of plastic bags and packaging is recyclable if taken to the supermarket, so I do that.


it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it's the best I can do right now. || We try to avoid bringing extra plastic into the house but it‚Äôs very hard, bc everything comes with plastic! 

If it‚Äôs possible I return the packaging. Our local nursery puts purchases on a plastic tray, but they take them back. There‚Äôs a produce market there too. They also allow people to return the cardboard fruit containers for berries as long as they‚Äôre in decent shape. 

We don‚Äôt use the thin plastic veg bags that grocery stores offer. We just leave things loose. We don‚Äôt take plastic shopping bags, and we don‚Äôt accept reusable bags either bc we have plenty. 

Just do your best. 

We have a personal goal of trying not to throw things in the garbage or recycling until they‚Äôve had at least 2 uses. Holey socks are used as dusters or used to pick up something gross (cat puke). Bags that tortillas or chocolate chips come in are used when we clean the cat litter. Other clean bags/boxes that somehow make it into the house are used when someone has purchased something from us and we leave it on our front stoop. Cracked plates become palettes for painting. Holey sheets become drop cloths. 

You‚Äôre doing great already even thinking about these things. Having it in your mind, you‚Äôll tend to make the right choices. || I haven't bought anything in plastic in about a year with the exception of medical prescriptions. It takes some creativity, but I've found that you can avoid it. I buy almost everything used off Facebook marketplace which avoids packaging for goods. I only buy stuff online if I know it won't come in plastic packaging. I buy most of my food at the farmer's market in my area and a local coop. If anything comes in plastic, I avoid it. Sometimes that means having to go to a different store for something or just saying no to a certain product until you can find a solution. I agree with what everyone's saying in terms of try your best and avoid where you can. I also wanted to add the perspective that if eliminating plastic completely is a goal, it is possible, it just takes commitment and some lifestyle adjustments || I can't speak to the plastic, but the cardboard is THE BEST.  I got a 24-sheet crosscut shredder from amazon, and now there is ZERO cardboard that leaves my house once it comes in.  I have a worm bin (one of the five-tier ones), and I use the cardboard in that, and I also have ducks that use it for bedding. I add more bedding every time the bin fills up, and every few months, I rake all of it out and throw it into a raised bed that I'll use next year, because crosscut-shredded cardboard plus duck poop equals the beginning of compost.  That plus my new hobby of mushroom growing (oyster mushrooms in shredded cardboard) means I get all excited when I get an amazon or walmart box, even when a toilet paper roll or paper towel roll becomes available. || Do you have www.ridwell.com in your area?

Eco friendly with kids.,What do you do at home to do your part to be more eco friendly? What reusable products do you use? I'm also wanting to be more eco friendly with my kids.,"We used reusable diapers and wipes and reused them for multiple kids. Bought secondhand clothes since they grow out of everything within a few months. Most of my first daughters clothes became my second daughters clothes. When clothes ripped or tore, I would patch them for continued wear. Bought or were gifted other used baby items like bouncer, jolly jumper, bassinet etc. Still to this day we have a giant pile of multi coloured baby washcloths that we use for hands and faces or as napkins at dinner time. || - cloth diaper & cloth wipe

- breastfeed; breastfeeding is simple but not easy, and like everyone else I know, I had trouble with it in the beginning. If I hadn't already established a habit of attending a support group before having kiddo, then I likely would have walked away due to the initial challenging month, but given as how I felt good about being vulnerable with the breastfeeding experts due to having already met them, I was very comfortable texting them during at 2 am feed and we worked through all of the challenges I was dealing with. I cannot stress enough how important it is to have support that you feel comfortable reaching out to at 2 am with even the silliest of questions and feeling comfortable that you aren't disturbing them or their sleep. It's the difference between being the 75% of Americans who stop breastfeeding by 9 months (most stopping in the first month or two or at the point of suck-pattern changes due to the introduction of straw cups around the 6 month mark) or the 25% who breastfeed through at least the first full year. My support group was La Leche League who can be *very intense* about breastmilk, but also who are free which worked for my budget, are the ones who carried lactation knowledge through the mid-century modernization of all-formula-all-the-time (yes, your IBCLC is educated due to La Leche League knowledge so I figured I'd get it from the source), and who currently invest the most into lactation and nursing research in the present. Whatever breastfeeding support group you go for, take what you need and ignore what you don't.

- Everything related to kiddo's solids consumption is reusable. Reusable water bottle. Reusable lunchbox. Reusable kid-friendly chopsticks. Reusable cups. Reusable cereal bowl. You get the point. Cloth napkin made from what were formerly cloth wipes.

- Hand me down or second hand wardrobe for kiddo.

- No shoes unless absolutely necessary. I live in the US south and it is currently summer-enough to go barefoot. I ran around barefoot when I was a youngling and so does kiddo. The bottoms of my feet are tough enough to be shoe leather (and coincidentally have never had athlete's foot; I think the two are connected) and while that doesn't match with the conventional view of feminine beauty, it has served me well and will serve kiddo well. I mention this because no shoes is more eco friendly than buying and discarding a size of shoes which is outgrown in a season. Plus it is so so so so so so so so so good for foot development in new walkers. Like obscenely good.

- All of our toys are either second hand or become second hand once we finish with them. We reject random tiny plastic crap designed to break quickly and be a quick dopamine hit.

- We got a diaper sprayer for the cloth diapers and it has transitioned into being a butt-gun bidet.

- Don't get a toilet opening size reducer when toilet training, just put kid on the toilet, straddling it, facing the tank. Same outcome, less unnecessary product. All products, ALL OF THEM, are eventual waste. And anything which cannot be composted is going to the landfill. Which is why REFUSE/REDUCE is the first and most important instruction.

- We started bicycle exposure as early as we could. We got (and gave away) second hand balance bikes of all kinds, starting with a four wheeled kind (back two wheels are closer together than front two wheels) at around one year old. The sooner we could normalize bicycling for longer distances than walking, the sooner we didn't have to go everywhere in the car for things which weren't walkable in a reasonable amount of time. Relatedly, The Mister who has more balance while operating a bicycle than I ever will, got handed down a child seat to add to his bicycle for additional support in messaging the bicycle message.

- I know how to forage and started passing on that information even before kiddo was verbal. Kiddo still isn't good enough at plant IDs to be able to go chew on nature without guidance, but has learned to check plant ID with me. Foraging taught right is the foundation of harmonious and sustainable coexistence with the natural world and is the foundation of the food forests. So in terms of a reusable product in this category, may I recommend taking a local foraging class with your children and using what you learned to reconsider any yardscaping you have currently? A food forest yard is way more better than landscaping-company-friendly perennials and can look just as pretty if not prettier.

- In terms of preschools, forest schools or playschools or any other type of preschool that better aligns with our values instead of being full of single-use throw-away culture was where we chose to put our money. Better for the Earth and instills the values we want to share right from the start. Does kiddo come home more muddy than they would if they went to the Church Preschool or the Institutional Montessori Preschool? Yes. But clothes and children are washable. || The most eco friendly thing is probably using condoms.

Buy in bulk || I don't have kids but wanted to hop on here and say I see a TON of really nice infant, baby, and children's stuff on Facebook marketplace. From glass bottles to reusable diapers to toys, furniture, decorations, etc. I think buying used is one of the best things you can do for the environment, so I would say in addition to what everyone else is saying, looking on Facebook marketplace for specific stuff that you would've purchased new and wouldn't have thought to look for used. I'd also say stay away from polyester stuffed animals and fabrics! It's not very mainstream to avoid it yet, but I think that stuff is really unhealthy and I would keep my kids away from itüòä || We use cloth napkins. Honest kids makes a cardboard container for their soap, which I like. Someone else mentioned the balance bike method - we did that, too, and try to bike or take the bus as much as possible.

But probably the biggest thing is avoiding single-serving plastic packaging - so very few store bought granola bars, mini chip bags, fruit snacks, applesauce pouches, etc. I try to make what I can at home (granola, crackers, popcorn, muffins) and what I can't make I buy rarely - and if I do I buy it in bulk and put single servings in reusable containers. It is so much easier to just buy those things (and we do when we feel like we're drowning) but we don't stock them probably them 90% of the time.

I also thrift virtually all of their clothes and toys. || Reusable and secondhand wherever possible, which is a lot.  Grow things together in a garden or potted plants. || We do our best, but it's definitely a challenge. We cloth diaper and rely on Buy Nothing groups on Facebook marketplace.

Place for reusable kcups,"Hi all, I work in a small office w/a keurig that is mostly used by patients. I am willing to pre-make k cups but curious about where and how to ask patients to not throw away reusable k cups. I know someone is gonna throw one in the garbage. We don't have any room on the counter of our small coffee bar. I thought about buying a hand towel rack and reusable bin and putting it next to the garbage so patients can put the resusable k cup in there and I'll take of them every few days. I'll do research into which kcup to buy, but trying to find ways to make it work. Over the last few months we have gotten completely away from plastic water bottles and just using refillable water bottles, mugs and stirrers, so just tackling the coffee. I'm not endorsing kcups or this style of coffee, but it is something that patients use. I'm open to another type of coffee maker too--but we already own the keurig. 

this [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B4SYY9ZW/ref=ox\_sc\_act\_title\_2?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B4SYY9ZW/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?th=1)

Yes, I will try to find them used, but to demonstrate what I'm thinking. Thanks!","The machine would need to be moved to the staff area. Patients can't be packing or handling the coffee grounds, it's a health hazard and a liability to the business. || I don't think it is worth it in an office setting.  Too many other people's behavior at play.

That said, buy a reusable K-cup for YOURSELF.  You can save old disposable k-cups for seed starters if you plant stuff. || Why not brew a whole pot? Less waste overall || The nespresso pods go into a little side container that way each user doesn‚Äôt have to manually take them out. Then you can send back the pods and they recycle the aluminum and compost the coffee. This is the best solution I‚Äôve found for pods - but doesn‚Äôt totally answer your question and wouldn‚Äôt be the most sustainable because you already have the keurig! 

So.. I think your solution is GOOD but not great. I worry the pre made k cups could get moldy (if you‚Äôre letting them sit for a few days), which could be a liability for the company. It‚Äôs also a large task for one person - do you have the time in your day to devote to this? Can someone else do it with you? I wouldn‚Äôt sign myself up for this, but unsure what your role is. I think a middle ground would be to use single use pods and then you can find a way to compost the grounds and recycle the plastic. I like your idea of the rack and little container for the pods though and you can still use it with this ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù approach. 

I appreciate your sustainability in your office though! I also push for this - we got a whole set of nice dishes and mugs and cups so that we don‚Äôt have to use single use. || I can't think of a reliable way to prevent them from throwing them out without just removing the garbage can completely.",6,ZeroWaste,2025-05-16 20:54:22,place reusable kcups,hi work small office w keurig mostly used patients willing pre make k cups curious ask patients throw away reusable k cups know someone gonna throw one garbage room counter small coffee bar thought buying hand towel rack reusable bin putting next garbage patients put resusable k cup take every days research kcup buy trying find ways make work last months gotten completely away plastic water bottles using refillable water bottles mugs stirrers tackling coffee endorsing kcups style coffee something patients use open another type coffee maker already keurig mounted yes try find used demonstrate thinking thanks,machine would need moved staff area patients packing handling coffee grounds health hazard liability business think worth office setting many people behavior play said buy reusable k cup save old disposable k cups seed starters plant stuff brew whole pot less waste overall nespresso pods go little side container way user manually take send back pods recycle aluminum compost coffee best solution found pods totally answer question sustainable already keurig think solution good great worry pre made k cups could get moldy letting sit days could liability company also large task one person time day devote someone else sign unsure role think middle ground would use single use pods find way compost grounds recycle plastic like idea rack little container pods though still use middle ground approach appreciate sustainability office though also push got whole set nice dishes mugs cups use single use think reliable way prevent throwing without removing garbage completely
Changing deodorant now that Wild has Sol to Unilever?,"I‚Äôve been using wild for a couple of years because I wanted to cut down on how much single use plastic I was using. 

My old style case gave up and I brought the new purple cat one. 

Then they sold to Unilever and I‚Äôve been annoyed about it since but havnt had to think about it too much as I still had refills I was using. 

But now I‚Äôm running out and am having a hard time deciding whether to switch brands and get a whole new system (meaning my case is useless) or just keep buying their refills. 

What are other people doing about wild? Are you changing brands? Or sticking with it as you are still not using single plastics even if the money is going to Unilever?

","For those who are wondering why it matters who owns your deodorant brand (or your anything brand), [this video](https://youtu.be/GsR_ZpVZAKc?feature=shared) makes a compelling case. I used to be ambivalent about parent companies too, but my perspective has shifted to make it a higher priority. || I use a brand called ***Humble*** ((corporate name is.. ***Humble Brands***)) found it one day when at Sprouts grocer. When I visited the website, it appears they are a small business based in New Mexico. Not all products are plastic free however they do have paper-tube deodorant line and I found that it works pretty well for me. || Apparently Fussy refills fit in the Wild cases. || Little Seed Farm is the most effective natural deodorant I‚Äôve ever tried. It comes in small glass jars with metal lids that are perfect for reusing, and one jar lasts me close to 3 months. || Isn‚Äôt the point of zero waste, and voting with our wallet, to influence these companies into avoiding single use plastic? So therefore what‚Äôs the problem if it‚Äôs derived from Unilever? Bad company. Sure. Don‚Äôt let perfection be the enemy of progress.¬†

I buy Native deodorant, comes in paper packaging. Proctor and Gamble owns them. That doesnt stress me out because I‚Äôm approving of them doing a good thing. And not wasting any plastic. || I‚Äôve been using Make Waves. Similar format, but supposedly anti-perspirant. It‚Äôs haven‚Äôt been in very sweaty enough situations to vouch for that, but I‚Äôve found that whilst it smells nice initially, I think it‚Äôs reacting with my sweat and ends up with a weird tangy vinegary smell, so not going to use it anymore. 

It might just be that one scent, but it‚Äôs not cheap and I don‚Äôt want to experiment. || ffs üò© all the sustainable brands get sold to them. || Fuck. I literally just found out about wild and bought a metal case last month TT__TT || I boycotted them when they shrinkflated the inserts. I've gone back to Potassium Alum and Perfume in glass. || Loveli is a Dutch company producing refillable, completely plastic-free and aluminium-free deodorant sticks! I love their coconut, apple blossom and fresh cotton deodorants. || shit, what's wrong with Unilever?? seems like every deodorant brand is getting boycotted for one reason or another, but I hadn't heard of anything about boycotting Unilever products (I'm based in the US) || Silver Falls Sustainable is made in Oregon with cardboard tubes! My favorite is the coconut and lavender scent. || Little seed farm!!!! || I like life supplies - they do a refillable antiperspirant || Maybe a dupe or knock off ? || Is anyone making their own rock crystal-based liquid deodorant?  I use crystal stick roller one (has liquid inside a roller ball) but they also sell a plain rock salt one, and I'd love to find a way to make liquid salt solution I can apply - that doesn't cost $7, and reusable applicator. || I also have a problem with deodorant. Many natural and sustainable brands are made with oils like coconut with wind up leaving greasy stains on my clothes over time. I have also found that most natural deodorants don't work well with nervous perspiration, including the rock crystal ones. I found this out earlier this year when I had a health scare and went through multiple rounds of testing. 

I often just use glycolic acid. I like the one from Good Molecules because, as far as I know, they have not sold out to a large company like The Ordinary did with Estee Lauder. I used Humble for a while but it was the worst for the greasy stains. I'm currently using Lafe's, which seems to work okay, but I have to keep an extra in my purse if I'm out and about.

The absolute best one I've used is Schmidt's charcoal deodorant. Mild smell, not too bad with greasy pit stains, definitely curbs odor without having to constantly reapply. But it does not come in a sustainable package.

Unfortunately, you may just have to play around with different types to see what works with your body chemistry as everyone's is different. || i‚Äôve just started using Fitpit (bought from greenwoman.co.uk) - it‚Äôs in a glass jar and it has really good reviews. good so far! || I'm using a diy deodorant now and it's really effective.  6 T coconut oil, 4 T baking soda, 4 T cornstarch and 16 drops of lavender essential oil.

Melt coconut oil in the microwave and combine the rest of the ingredients, mixing well.  I transfered this into a all jar while melted and it solidified into a creamy texture.

Thoughts on ecosia search engine??,"Hi all! I‚Äôve been a lurker on this sub for a little while, and I‚Äôm very passionate about environmental causes. I recently stumbled across some posts about this search engine, that claims to offset the environmental impact of your searches by planting trees. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about them and whether or not it‚Äôs just greenwashing. I‚Äôd love to hear everyone‚Äôs opinions ","I use ecosia. maybe it's somewhat green washed, I haven't done a very deep dive, but they seem to have some real impact and they don't give AI results by default like chrome and edge so at a minimum it's using significantly less water per search. || [removed] || Started using a few months ago, love it so far! Also started using it because useless Gemini search results started clogging my search results and I could not turn them off. I haven't vetted the tree planting but that's a bonus to me. || I have been using it for years and I really like it || I like it because it doesn't have the terrible Google AI summary, bonus that it's more environmentally friendly. I don't think there is any harm and I don't think they are green-washy || I use them and I like it. They do make money from ads like most browsers but they use those profits for environmental projects mostly tree planting. || Have been using it for years. They are fairly transparant about where their money goes. I used to  look at their monthly financial report which seemed legit. 
I also love that they have a leaf pictogram for many sustainable sites and a factory one for very unsustainable ones. || I use it. I like it. I don't get the sense they're greenwashing. || There used to be a tree counter on there that would tell you roughly how many trees you‚Äôve planted iirc and now it‚Äôs gone for some reason, I still use it though || Yeah I've used it for years it's pretty good. It's Bing on the backend I think. || I‚Äôve liked Ecosia however your search results will be far more limited than say, Google search. || I've been using it for many years! Very happy with it. || I use it! Works great || Something I'd like to point out is that Ecosia does use AI via its [""Ecosia Chat"" service](https://support.ecosia.org/article/534-ecosia-chat-ai). The company does claim that the carbon footprint of the service is offset by its infrastructure, claiming to be ""200% carbon negative.""

I've also been unable to find out what Ecosia uses to host their infrastructure and if that infrastructure is carbon neutral, which is strange for an environmentally-friendly search engine. Digital services that use carbon-neutral infrastructure usually state it explicitly. Using mailbox.org as an example, they explicitly state on their website that their infrastructure is in-house and is powered by green energy.

Overall I think it's another greenwashed service. I haven't looked much into the logistics of their tree planting so I can't say anything about it. || I used ecosia for a few years, and it was just okay for a search engine. It really started getting annoying when it would assume I wanted to buy products and heaped on ads instead of allowing me to do research, so I switched to Duck Duck Go.¬† || I looked up ""baby peacock"" in image search and it was flooded with AI pics just like Google... || so did they stop using ai? i last went to them bc i assumed they wouldn‚Äôt (ECOsia) but if they got rid of it they‚Äôll get me back || I‚Äôve been using their app TreeCard which supposedly plants trees for your steps || I'm a fan of it. It returns actual results, not AI hallucinations and SEO ads. Also, just fuck Google in general, the only thing Google products I use are YouTube, since there isn't a viable alternative, and Gmail for my burner email addy. || Its a german GmbH, that means they have to release public information every year (Ecosia does it even more often tho) here is a link: [https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/](https://blog.ecosia.org/ecosia-financial-reports-tree-planting-receipts/)

How am I supposed to buy underwear?,"I haven't bought new underwear in about a decade but, as some commenters pointed out in r/BuyItForLife, underwear may not be a buyitforlife item. My underwear is slowly getting retired and what's left is in pretty poor shape. The problem is, I don't know what underwear I like or what size to get, or how to find out in a sustainable way.

I'm not in love with most of the undies I have (except one brandless, anonymous pair üò≠), so I can't just order some I know I like. Most stores won't let me try on, which basically leaves me with a buy then return approach (though sorting out who allows underwear return is a process). Is that the only way?

  
I'm starting to think everybody just buys random underwear until they find ones that fit and feel good, and then tosses or ignores a bunch of undies they didn't like in the process. Normally, for things like this, I go to Poshmark, or another resale site (to avoid giving money to yucky manufacturers and creating new things), but those sites don't have returns as far as I know. 

  
I feel like I might get dragged in the comments, but I'm really just trying to get new underwear without buying a bunch of new shit that I don't like/use, thus creating waste. I'd also love to keep it frugal.","The ones that don't make the cut are for periods+laundry day. I'm sure you could repurpose them too, especially if you only wear them once/try on. Maybe try a few types from a brand you want to support and then go from there. || Listen, it's all fine to want to be frugal and waste less, but traditionally clothing close to the skin is made exclusively with renewable materials. And purposely so! Of course there is a problem with massive amounts of wood / textile waste but something like 5 pairs of socks a year, or a pound of paper, is absolutely not a big deal. It doesn't make sense to reduce your consumption to zero: life produces waste and the waste is part of the cycle of life.

The only real problem I can see is when the waste product itself is not useful or harmful to the environment, or it is completely disproportionate to it's use pattern. You could conceivably grow and wear and waste your own textiles if you owned a farm and there would be zero environmental impact. Luckily you don't have to do that, though unfortunately materials like organic cotton and ethically / sustainably produced textiles are going to be more expensive to produce. Where my ancestors come from wool is used for everything including underwear, though that is much more difficult to find nowadays. || If you buy a multi pack and just try one pair, if you don‚Äôt like it you can toss that pair and then donate the rest of the pack to a homeless shelter. They always need new undergarments for the people who stay there. || I buy organic cotton bikini underwear from Pact. I like it well enough, and the six-packs are reasonably priced for organic cotton. I'm sure there's something better out there, but I'm not willing to buy a bunch of different brands/styles to try to find the ""perfect"" pair. || honestly i am such a fan of auden brand bikini underwear at target. say what you want about big box stores but i do not know many independent underwear manufacturers lol
their's holds up well and is super comfortable || Duluth buck naked || Start off with brands/ places that sell individuals pairs. Buy a few different styles and narrow down that part. Sizing can differ with brands, so start with style/ shape. Also pay attention to which fabrics/ blends feel best for you. || I have no practical advice but I totally relate. 

I‚Äôm like.. idk maybe my ass is shaped weird? I feel like a lot of stuff doesn‚Äôt fit great. And I try to buy only 100% cotton, so options are limited. Seriously I‚Äôm thinking about trying to sew my own. || You could try MeUndies, the quality is really lovely and it‚Äôs tencel. So, somewhat more sustainable and mine have lasted ages || Honestly I hadn‚Äôt been happy with a lot of the ones I hear recommended for quality. Either because the quality wasn‚Äôt what I expected or I didn‚Äôt like the fit. I ended up making my own by copying the pattern of an old pair I liked. || I have worked in retail way too long, including as a fitting room attendant. People do try them on, but please try them on over your current underwear. Not that people follow that rule in fitting rooms with the swim wear or underwear, or anything else (they try on jeans and body suits while going commando). Seen so many bottoms with skid marks and various bodily fluids and discharge on them left on fitting room floors. Which brings me to my final point:

You should wash new clothes before you wear them, because new does not equal clean. || I currently wear women‚Äôs boxer briefs because they are comfy.  However, I generally buy like one pair to see if I like them.  Then, even if I don‚Äôt like them very much, I wear them anyway.if I like them, I stock up. || I've stuck with TomboyX for a while. They're a B Corp which is a sign that they try to do things sustainably and ethically, and I've had most of my pairs for a few years without issue. I will say that with anything, modal/micromodal wears out much faster. I get the cotton, and while it's more expensive than most places, I've only had 2 pairs wear out, one got too baggy after a few years of washing, and the other got a hole under the waistband. 

Although I'm trying to learn to make my own. I got a lot of secondhand fabric, or leftovers from other things, so I have some bamboo knit fabric that I've had for a while, and so far so good, it's just hard to find comfy elastic for the waist. || Do you have a sewing machine? I make all my new underwear out of old T-shirts. || I have been liking boody brand bamboo underwear lately. I have some from bombas I also like. || My favorite is bamboo underwear is from Boody. It‚Äôs so comfortable and durable. I like the lyolyte fabric and it‚Äôs worth a few extra dollars to me. || you can measure yourself to match up with sizing on websites. not a perfect solution but better than pure guesswork || I have done mostly trial and error and I buy ~3 pairs when I try a new brand

I find that as long as I pick sensible cuts, each pair finds its purpose! Some underwear is best with jeans, some with leggings, some with athletic shorts, etc

Some I like better than others but at the end of the day I like having a variety

My favorites so far are the boy short and no-show styles from MeUndies (the no show is polyester - but alas all good no shows are)

From a frugality standpoint, I get most of my underwear from the ‚Äúsale section‚Äù so lots of ugly prints but it‚Äôs underwear so I dgaf 

Also! Don‚Äôt forget you can repair undies too. I have some old Victoria‚Äôs Secret no-shows that I love but they have all ripped in the gooch because low quality - those babies are sewn back together and I‚Äôll keep wearing them until they literally disintegrate off of me || On the list of concerns about things where you can cut back and be zero waste, underwear choice should be at the very bottom. 

Different people have different underwear needs.   Are you fat or thin? Are you sensitive to different types of fibers (silk/nylon)? IMHO the best thing to use is a pair of pure cotton briefs. || I realize this isn‚Äôt for everyone, but I sew my own. 

I sew most of my own clothes to begin with, so all jersey knit scraps that are too small to become anything become underwear. I buy elastic in bulk, so it‚Äôs cheap and easy. I have a few favourite patterns that I have traced onto card stock. I also love to make matching pair of boxer briefs for my partner so that we match :) I‚Äôve even been successful with making my own bras and period underwear.",222,ZeroWaste,2025-05-15 06:49:53,supposed buy underwear,bought new underwear decade commenters pointed r buyitforlife underwear may buyitforlife item underwear slowly getting retired left pretty poor shape problem know underwear like size get find sustainable way love undies except one brandless anonymous pair order know like stores let try basically leaves buy return approach though sorting allows underwear return process way starting think everybody buys random underwear find ones fit feel good tosses ignores bunch undies like process normally things like go poshmark another resale site avoid giving money yucky manufacturers creating new things sites returns far know feel like might get dragged comments really trying get new underwear without buying bunch new shit like use thus creating waste also love keep frugal,ones make cut periods laundry day sure could repurpose especially wear try maybe try types brand want support go listen fine want frugal waste less traditionally clothing close skin made exclusively renewable materials purposely course problem massive amounts wood textile waste something like pairs socks year pound paper absolutely big deal make sense reduce consumption zero life produces waste waste part cycle life real problem see waste product useful harmful environment completely disproportionate use pattern could conceivably grow wear waste textiles owned farm would zero environmental impact luckily though unfortunately materials like organic cotton ethically sustainably produced textiles going expensive produce ancestors come wool used everything including underwear though much difficult find nowadays buy multi pack try one pair like toss pair donate rest pack homeless shelter always need new undergarments people stay buy organic cotton bikini underwear pact like well enough six packs reasonably priced organic cotton sure something better willing buy bunch different brands styles try find perfect pair honestly fan auden brand bikini underwear target say want big box stores know many independent underwear manufacturers lol holds well super comfortable duluth buck naked start brands places sell individuals pairs buy different styles narrow part sizing differ brands start style shape also pay attention fabrics blends feel best practical advice totally relate like idk maybe ass shaped weird feel like lot stuff fit great try buy cotton options limited seriously thinking trying sew could try meundies quality really lovely tencel somewhat sustainable mine lasted ages honestly happy lot ones hear recommended quality either quality expected like fit ended making copying pattern old pair liked worked retail way long including fitting room attendant people try please try current underwear people follow rule fitting rooms swim wear underwear anything else try jeans body suits going commando seen many bottoms skid marks various bodily fluids discharge left fitting room floors brings final point wash new clothes wear new equal clean currently wear women boxer briefs comfy however generally buy like one pair see like even like much wear anyway like stock stuck tomboyx b corp sign try things sustainably ethically pairs years without issue say anything modal micromodal wears much faster get cotton expensive places pairs wear one got baggy years washing got hole waistband although trying learn make got lot secondhand fabric leftovers things bamboo knit fabric far good hard find comfy elastic waist sewing machine make new underwear old shirts liking boody brand bamboo underwear lately bombas also like favorite bamboo underwear boody comfortable durable like lyolyte fabric worth extra dollars measure match sizing websites perfect solution better pure guesswork done mostly trial error buy pairs try new brand find long pick sensible cuts pair finds purpose underwear best jeans leggings athletic shorts etc like better others end day like variety favorites far boy short show styles meundies show polyester alas good shows frugality standpoint get underwear sale section lots ugly prints underwear dgaf also forget repair undies old victoria secret shows love ripped gooch low quality babies sewn back together keep wearing literally disintegrate list concerns things cut back zero waste underwear choice bottom different people different underwear needs fat thin sensitive different types fibers silk nylon imho best thing use pair pure cotton briefs realize everyone sew sew clothes begin jersey knit scraps small become anything become underwear buy elastic bulk cheap easy favourite patterns traced onto card stock also love make matching pair boxer briefs partner match even successful making bras period underwear
Muffin/Cupcake Liners,Hi all! Any suggestions for an affordable and sustainable muffin/cupcake liner solution? I make homemade muffins every week for breakfasts and end up going through a lot of liners. I tried a silicone muffin tin but it made the bake times too long and led to burnt tops and undercooked middles. I switched to paper liners I thought were compostable but I don‚Äôt think they are. Do the silicone reusable liners affect bake time like the whole tray did? Looking for the most economical and ecologically friendly solution. ,"Have you tried just greasing the muffin tin? Liners are super convenient, but not 100% necessary in my experience. || I've used the silicone muffin liners and haven't noticed too much of an issue myself! Maybe affects the bake time juuust slightly (takes a tiny bit longer). I've seen people use parchment paper (make sure u find eco-friendly non coated stuff) to make muffin liners (cutting a square and making certain folds for a nice wrapped look) and in theory that would be compostable || [If You Care Baking Cups](https://ifyoucare.com/baking/p/large-baking-cups) are said to be compostable. || I have the silicone muffin liners and I haven't noticed any difference in cook times.  I use them inside a standard metal muffin pan.  The ones from Crate & Barrel that I have are nice and thick; the Amazon ones are thin/flimsy, but that does make them a bit more similar to paper liners and they take less room to store.  My biggest issue with them is that they hold flavors -- the last few batches I've used them for, I felt like I could taste the dishwasher :( || I would simply grease and dust the muffin tray with flour. Easy peasy, no new products to buy. || I grease up the tins super well. We use lard, but I‚Äôm sure you could use whatever.

(I am NOT an experienced baker, but this is what works for meeeee) || So I don't make muffins but I make egg bites in a muffin tray. I use silicone muffin mold and it's absolutely wonderful. Nothing sticks. It's great.

Another possibility is the silicone muffin trays which I got recently and vastly prefer. Both do increase the back time slightly by approximately 5 minutes. 

I find they're really worth it. || I use silicone muffin/cupcake liners and really like them. I put them in a metal muffin tin and they take a couple of minutes more to bake. When washing them I put them in hot soapy water, let sit for a couple of minutes and then rince and air dry. Works great. || The old school way :
You grease the muffin tin lightly with butter (or fat of your choice) then sprinkle flour in the tin, shake it around to coat. Tap and pour out excess flour.
It works pretty well. Works best if you take the baked item out while still warm. If you wait too long can cling to the tin. || Growing up, I always thought the families that had those silicone liners for classroom cupcakes were rich. 

I don't see a difference in the product using them, but they are kinda annoying to clean with all those ridges. Have you tried just baking them directly in your greased muffin pan? || I use the silicone ones.

How far would you go with zero-waste?,"It's easy to go zero-waste when you're buying relatively virgin products like, products in glass jars and things. But I have a radical thought, would you buy products made out of food waste? What if toys were made from avocado seeds - would that be too ick? ","I have some jewelry made out of avocado pits. It's not weird or ick, it's just a seed that's been carved. You can also make dye with the skins (it's pink!). Now if we're talking something like rotten food I meat, that's nasty shit. || I think zero waste means making the most of whatever you're presented, which I see as, say, keeping a jar from a finished ingredient or replacing my single use plastics with durable and clean/safe alternatives. 

The line of ""ick"" theoretically would be crossing the line into something that is a biohazard (unclean/unhealthy), like reusing needles if someone has diabetes. Some things sadly have to be single use for the sake of health and safety. 

Until that point, though, the question of ""clean"" and ""healthy"" is a more personal boundary. ""Food Waste"" in many ways isn't actually waste itself, it's a perfectly viable resource that we've wasted/underutilized. || I find that when I remind myself that I'm fighting capitalist consumerism, my motivation to to waste as little as possible increases || Yeah, I also hang out in the r/anticonsumerism sub.  The two kinda go hand in hand. || I‚Äôm here strictly for info on how to get better at using less. My favorite I found lately was ‚Äúdrying pads‚Äù for bidet use. I never come back with streaks on the TP after pressure washing, and we go through less TP overall, but still a good amount. 

That option is too ick for the wife to answer your question. I would, she wouldn‚Äôt, so we prolly won‚Äôt. || I mean, it depends on what you mean by food waste. I would probably be into something like scrubber pads made from coconut husks. But if we're talking, like, orange peels and apple cores, I would think those are probably better off being composted.

And to answer your specific question, I think toys made from avocado pits could be cool! Though I'd be a little worried about potential choking hazards... || Not too ick, too choking hazard.

Unless you mean adult toys. Ben Wa balls from avocado seeds is an interesting concept. || for example I saw a video from business insider where one company was making pineapple or mango forget which into leather and another company was making fish scales into leather that could be used in fashion instead of wasted and I thought the idea was cool. i saw another channel thought empurioum (not sure if spelled right i think I got  right channel at least I hope) he tried making milk and shrimp scales into yarn (in two differnce videos and it was extreme neat idea. The only thing I wouldn't do when it comes to zero waste is literally eating food out of a dumpster, eating expired food, using all natural products aka things that never been proven to cure or take care of or prevent a medical problem || One of my cat's favorite toys is literally an avocado pit. || Everything you eat is made out of food waste.

is it just me or has zero waste gotten kind of... branded,"not trying to hate on the movement at all but lately i‚Äôve been noticing how everything ‚Äúzero waste‚Äù feels like it has its own aesthetic now. like the glass containers, the wood brushes, the linen everything. and yeah it looks nice but it‚Äôs also expensive. feels like you can‚Äôt just reuse old tupperware anymore it has to be some hand-blown jar from a farmers market in 2016

also kind of weird how a lot of the stuff marketed as zero waste still comes wrapped in like three layers of paper and a wax seal and a mission statement. not saying it‚Äôs fake just wondering how it got so curated. curious if anyone else has felt this or if i‚Äôm just being cynical again","Not just you. Oddly enough ""zero waste"" has become very consumerist, looking for newer nicer ""eco friendly"" swaps. I think using a plastic tupperware you thrifted is more ""zero waste"" than tossing your tupperware and buying new glass ones that take more resources to produce || Like the company that supposedly aims to reduce single use plastic claiming to be the last time you'd buy that product, and you go on their website and they have subscriptions?? And a whole bunch of versions of items as simple as cotton swabs? No one needs a ""PRO cotton swab"". Thanks, capitalism. || Absolutely. Zero waste is near impossible anyways so just trying to reduce your waste and reusing the items you already have accomplishes more. So that plastic clam shell that pastries come in? I grow microgreens in it instead of going out and buying a fancy microgreen growing kit. The Panera cups I get for my drinks are perfect for my tomato starts for my garden. The paper bags I get when I forget to take my cloth bags to the store? They get shredded and put in my worm composting bin as browns. The plastic tub my talenti ice cream comes in? Oh that has a million uses around the house. There are ""zero waste"" versions of each product out there that I am not buying because I can simply reuse things I have that came as part of  different product purchase.

My take is that this overall results in reduced use of resources which is less wasteful. Shipping, transportation, packaging of products also creates waste. I live in a small town so if ai want biodegradable plant starting trays I am going to have to order them online. The product is going to have packaging. Then some human is going to print a label and package it in a cardboard box and shio it to me. Some ups driver is going to make an extra stop at my house to deliver it. Or I can re-use that Panera cup  that was delivered to Panera in bulk along with all their other deliveries where a single stop was made. My not reusing that Panera cup isn't going to change the size of their delivery or orders. But it will prevent a whole lot of extra packaging and resources being used just so I could feel good about using zero waste seed starting containers that honestly aren't nearly as good as the Panera cups.

I replaced all my plastic Tupperware as it failed but my mom has the same plastic rubber made food storage she had when I was a baby which far less waste. Repurpose what you have to fit the need>buy used>buy the most sustainable option you can afford (plastic Tupperware is more sustainable then the glass ones with a bamboo lid that crack after 6months‚Ä¶.) || Definitely not just you! There is SO MUCH packaging in the zero waste space now. 

I remember seeing a YouTube video from a zero waste blog last year all about ""zero waste stores we love"" and every.single.product. that they showed had a bunch of packaging. The part that really got me, though, was that they never opened a single one to show the actual products, but kept saying how much they loved the packaging. üôÑ

It's so unfortunate that we're losing the plot in many ways. || The most zero waste thing you can use is the thing you already own || I saw something a few years ago about how ‚Äúbig business is just trying to sell us more less now‚Äù and it feels very true || People can't make money off people who reuse, repair, and repurpose. To sell is to market. To market is to create a desirable look that people want to buy. That new garbage is what gets shared in glossy ads and influencer posts. Just opt out and choose ignore on that stuff and it should reduce in volume. || The influencers need a way to communicate in an insta photo that they are part of a vibe and not just part of the ugly poors. 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è the whole Internet aesthetic ruins everything. || I‚Äôd say definitely not cynical, since it became a ‚Äòcool‚Äô thing to do brands have jumped on it no end and ‚Äòzero waste‚Äô influencers exist who push having specific products which urges brands to create stuff etc‚Ä¶ so it‚Äôs not really zero waste just trendy using the words || Felt it kinda lose its core when the swaps became trendy around 2019 and just another way to ""consume yourself into sustainability"". People forgot or didn't learn the core of it but wanted to participate and ""look right""


Also feel like the pandemic reintroduced a lot of packaging for safety reasons¬† || It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs good business practice to target multiple niches. It increases your reach, which is even more important when you sell multi-use products, since you‚Äôre limited in how many people will repurchase.

There is considerable overlap between eco-conscious consumers and natural living. Someone into natural living will probably get rid of their old plastic Tupperware out of fear of plastic leeching, for example. This is also why it‚Äôs hard to find fluoride zero waste toothpaste and aluminum antiperspirant, because natural living folks want products without them.

You also need to sell more than a product. There are tons of people who want to be sold an idea, not necessarily just a product, and the aesthetics of zero waste accomplish that. There are other ways to sell it, but aesthetics are a big driver of selling the lifestyle. 

Not defending it, just explaining. I am not into natural living, so I actually get frustrated with zero waste product selections all the time. Most of it irritates my skin or doesn‚Äôt even really work. || Everyone has a fantasy self and a horror self. Consumerism thrives where people buy things for their fantasy self (""if I just buy this purple sweater, I'll be so happy"" ""I won't buy packaged noodles if I just buy this glass jar with a bamboo top to put bulk noodles in"") or to avoid their horror self (""I'm might be cold on vacation so I need to buy a down puffer coat to wear"").

There are a lot of people who want to be counter-culture and zero-waste. They fantasize of the homesteading life or the slow living Beatrix Potter life where they turn their husband's old boot into a sunflower planter while rabbits in dinner jackets run around their cabbage patch.

So when a company comes along selling them a glass jar with a bamboo top while using all that evocative imagery, unless they are hip to the psychology of the fact that their fantasy self is a total fiction, they open their wallets and spend.

You absolutely can just reuse tupperware. But if you do, companies don't make money.

Companies are opportunists, everywhere there is a fantasy self or a horror self, they are. Sometimes the exact same company that's making glass tubes designed to be crushed at a wedding is also selling glass jars with bamboo tops. They want ALL the money and they'll give you some mission statement about environmentalism on the one hand while producing specifically disposable items on the other hand. And if not the company, than the factory the company sources from. VERY FEW companies are vertically integrated and own their own factories. || Reusing old is fine but we‚Äôre also in the spot where when you do need to replace something the green replacement is expensive. || Oh yeah, for sure. There‚Äôs capitalism and marketing for sure, always looking for a new thing to exploit. But beyond that, if you‚Äôre doing Zero Waste right, you really can‚Äôt do too much with social media. If you have a proper capsule wardrobe, all your selfies are going to loom the same. And unless you‚Äôre going to take your hand-me-down Thermos and put it in a box every couple weeks for no reason, you can‚Äôt do an ‚Äúunboxing.‚Äù No one‚Äôs going to pay for a promoted post about how plain white vinegar can clean and disinfect almost anything.

Unless you‚Äôre going to update us annually, ‚Äú12, 13, 14 years and going strong!‚Äù 

I think the people doing Zero Waste the best are the ones posting about it the least because there‚Äôs really nothing to say. And people brand new to it don‚Äôt have the decade old Tupperware to not throw out in the first place. So they have to buy something new and (hopefully) sustainable and durable. That‚Äôs why there are so many posts about buying stuff here.

So yeah, there are bad actors out there for sure but also ZW is just fundamentally incompatible with social media || True zero waste is ugly. My dad has been doing zero waste since I was a kid, and let me tell you I never knew that ‚ÄúTupperware‚Äù didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúcountry crock‚Äù written on the side.

Once you‚Äôre done with it you can just clean it and put it in your compost.

Cow milk delivery vs. buying oat milk,"Hey people,

Our family consumes a lot of milk and I have a dilemma, hoping for your advice.

Currently we have a cow milk delivery in reusable thick glass bottles: we give them back empty bottles, they clean and reuse it for next deliveries. I really love the concept as it avoids the waste.

However, I was thinking to switch from the cow milk to oat milk because we all know the environmental impact and treatment of cattle...

The issue is, the oat milk comes in those Tetra Pak plastiky-cardboard packages. Theoretically, they are recyclable in our town, but again, Tetra Pak are known to be really hard to recycle because it's a combo of different materials and in general most of plastic is not recycled anyway due to cost, contamination and other issues. I have little faith in recycling and just trying to reduce amount of trash as much as possible.

So, what's in your opinion lesser evil? Cow milk in reusable glass bottles or oat milk in tetra pak?

EDIT: wow, I didn't know that making oat milk in not a rocket science and I can make it myself! Thank you, zero-wasters, I'm going to try it!","Okay I just wanted to add something I haven't seen yet! I support the switching to oatmilk rather than refillable dairy for the ethical and environmental factors. And definitely making oat milk at home is the best of both worlds!

Just making sure you're aware, most packaged oatmilks are fortified with Vitamin D and so is cow's milk. Homemade oatmilk will not have any of this bc homemade. So if you're not getting your vitamin D from anywhere else be aware! 

good luck!!

Edit! also if you want to make milk that's close to the protein content of cow's milk soy milk is also easy to make at home if you can find soy beans in your are. and also if your family likes it, soy milk is ... beany (I'm LOVE soy milk but recognize I'm not the norm, even among vegans üò≠). || Oat milk is pretty easy to make. We tend to make it every Sunday for the week. It also has less stuff in it. || Animal agriculture creates a LOT more waste than those tetrapaks. Not to mention the rest of the ethical consequences.¬†

It‚Äôs also pretty easy to make your own oat milk || I‚Äôve had an [almond cow](https://almondcow.co/) for a couple years and it is amazing. It‚Äôs basically a blender with a filter basket. A full cycle fills up 2 large mason jars. Check them out if you can ‚úåÔ∏è || It‚Äôs reaaaaaaaaally easy to DIY oat milk. You just need a blender and a fine strainer. Takes make 5 min || I think it's in favor of plant milk.

Solid waste is just one issue. Resource use and environmental impact are bigger. Crops are way better eaten directly than first fed to animals and then eaten.

Plus, it's just not happening that farms will deprioritize making money off the cows above all else, so ""ethical"" treatment of them is not something I'm looking for. They won't be able to convince me every employee in their supply chain has been consistently treating those animals with basic respect and attention above all. And it bothers me, even if they were treated pretty nicely, that they're sold when they're not profitable. Male calves, older females. Who knows how they're treated by the next handlers? except of course that they're killed for the meat. I just don't feel like doing that if I could just have plant milk instead.

I'm not even 100% vegan, so no judgement here, just that if this is something you're torn about and are trying to hear others' thoughts on, here are mine.

Have you tried all your options? Nut milks can be very easy to make, don't make them harder than they need to be. If I'm just putting them on cereal, I don't even strain them, depending on what I used, which is really the only pain point in making nut milks, imo. I blend peanuts, cashews, hempseeds, walnuts, almonds, even sesame seeds, with warm water, then add ice to chill and blend for a few more seconds. You can use literally any nut, make it as creamy as you like. Peanut butter also makes nice milk, even without a blender.

Try to use the store bought oat milk where it's really providing value (tea/coffee; truly really rushed days; drinking plain with a PB&J) and branch out where possible (cereal, smoothies, baking) to something stupid easy like (blend nuts and seeds with water for 45 seconds). || Both are more eco-friendly than buying milk at the grocery store.

Milk and oat milk are different products. If you want non animal derived milk - we know that can be better for the environment long term via lifestyle analysis.

However, if you aren't vegan and drink milk for other reasons (like you have a toddler who chugs whole milk and needs the fat for brain development), don't sweat it.

We don't need to be perfect here. Both are better options. || Y'all making oat milk at home. Any concerns about nutritional value vs milk? And do you add sugar to make it taste good? || make your own milks. Easy peasy. Better for you too. || oat milk is the easiest to make , here I buy it (edit it was refering to oats) in bulk store or in paper bags.

it's so much cheaper than to buy it. easy and I just use fine strainer no nut bag nonsense.

cow milk come from so much waste and water to get to you in opposition of plant based milk. || We get oat milk deliveries which come in glass bottles and get returned back to them, is this an option for you? || Oatly and Planet Oat both taste great and don't come in Tetra Pack containers. I especially like Oatly. || Quite aside from the environmental impact dairy milk is significantly more nutritious than is oat milk, which is effectively an ultra processed food, particularly if you're buying it commercially in plastic containers.¬†


If you decide to go oat milk, make sure you account for the fact that your kids are missing out on a ton of protein, lipids, micronutrients, etc.


Making it yourself doesn't really improve it, as you basically *have* to add sugar to make it palatable to kids, so you go from a highly nutritious drink like milk to what's basically an oaty sugar punch.¬†


Disclaimer: I'm not trying to say in any way that oat milk can't be a healthy choice, just that OP shouldn't treat this change like a one-question decision and if they do they need to account for the change in overall macro/micro nutrient intake.¬† || I use an almond cow, I got it on eBay, amazing! || oat milk is so easy to make. we were making our own almond for a while. || Like others have said, oat milk is so easy to make it is not worth buying. They Way overcharge for that stuff. But.. also. Oat milk tastes Very different. If you're wanting a 1 for 1 swap, it's not going to taste the same. Especially if you have kids, the switch may not be well received. I like oat milk and cow's milk, but one is not like the other. || I dont think anyone here mentioned buying powdered oat milk? I buy mine from Blue Farm. It‚Äôs the same price as the tetra packs but I can make small amounts at a time so it doesn‚Äôt go bad and I don‚Äôt waste oat milk anymore. When ever I run out of milk, I just scoop, add water, shake and it‚Äôs ready. I love it. I buy a huge bag of it that lasts forever. || i don‚Äôt know where you are, but in my area a couple of the milk delivery companies also do oat milk in glass bottles! worth checking a couple companies around you!! or suggesting it to them || A bunch of the milk delivery companies around here, South UK, deliver oat milk in glass bottles and collect them the same way as the milk/juice etc. Check it out where you are¬† || Something else to consider would be a nutr milk machine.

Help me break my mac and cheese cup dependence,"Hi people! So I am terrible at feeding myself and I love the kraft mac cups-- I ate them for every lunch in high school they have some nostalgia value. But ew single use plastic containers. And they are pricey for what they are.
I am really looking to get as close to that taste as possible- I have a selective eating disorder so I am pretty discriminating to taste here (like i don't like off brand mac cups)
Not interested in nutritional advice, thanks! I have a dietician and a therapist. 

Looks like it will be some powdered cheese, maybe cornstarch (the white powder) and macaroni noodles.
Anyone tried it or have any suggestions? Apparently its usually maltodextrin but thats bad for gut microbiome maybe? Would cornstarch probably work? 
","Is it a portion size thing? KD is my guilty pleasure but I buy the boxes and split them into two portions using kitchen scales. The box is cardboard but the little pouch of cheese powder still has plastic though :( || You can buy cheese powder in bulk from bulk barn and other similar stores, same with macaroni. Cheaper, less waste, and you can control the cheese ratio! || [https://www.hoosierhillfarm.com/milk-cheese-powders/](https://www.hoosierhillfarm.com/milk-cheese-powders/) Check out this brand! Just add noodles || This is not perfect, but Kraft sells easy mac in pouches instead of the cups. Less overall waste, but you get the exact same thing. || Ok I‚Äôm ready to get downvoted to oblivion for this, but I see this as akin to a medical issue, and one of those times where your health is more important than the waste issue. I think it‚Äôs great you‚Äôre looking for lower waste ideas, and I hope you find something that works for you. If you don‚Äôt find another way to feed yourself, I think you should eat what works for you, and find other places in your life to work on reducing waste. Fed is best, for humans of all ages. || If the only hang-up in using the box version is the difficulty preparing, there are containers specifically for microwaving noodles that might work for this. 

I've also made the box kind on the stove by mixing the milk, butter, noodles, and adding enough water to just cover the noodles, and the noodles absorb everything, and then I have my mac and cheese with fewer steps. It makes it easy enough for me and tastes the same to me, but I understand that may not cut it for you. 

And if you can't eliminate this item, that's ok. You aren't single handedly destroying everything, and you can make a difference in other ways. Please don't feel guilty in feeding yourself. || Is there any particular reason you don‚Äôt want to switch over to regular box KD? || Learning to cook for yourself and trying new foods is a core part of transitioning out of adolescence and into adulthood and can be a very enjoyable part about growing up. Try to learn how to prepare or cook something that you like and establish a routine of doing so! You can do these things even while having a selective eating disorder and in fact they will help you with that. || Have you tried Kraft not from the cups?  I've never had it from a cup, but I'd always assumed that it was identical to the boxed ones... || Not sure where you're located but I believe they actually sell the kraft dinner powder at bulk Barn!

Edited to say I looked it up and it doesn't list kraft dinner as the brand so it may be some no name version. I too love KD and understand many substitutes don't cut it. BUT in the course of looking it up I found KD actually sells their powder in a large shaker container, so while there's still packaging, it's recyclable/repurposeable and the ratio of cheese servings to waste is much better. Hope this helps, good luck :) || Purchase whole wheat elbow macaroni. Both make it and freeze it in one cup servings. And then go buy a Tostitos brand cheese dip. Take a couple tablespoons of that cheese dip and top it in the one cup servings after their thawed. Now you have your own macaroni and cheese just a little bit healthier. To make it healthier read the labels on the back of the cheese dip jars. You can also make your own cheese sauce with liquid and bulk or shredded cheese on the stove. Then set an individual servings. Freezer refrigerate. || I agree with the other poster, fed is best! But if you want a little bit of a cheaper option, they have kraft single serve packets you can make in the microwave. I used to eat these all the time and they tasted the same as the cups. You'd just use your own bowl. It might be a little less wasteful while ensuring you're still able to eat. Just be sure to leave the bowl soaking in some water so the cheese is easy to wash off. || I make like 3 boxes of it at once (if I‚Äôm feeling up to it) and portion it out. I tried to reuse the little cups but they suck for storage. 3 boxes makes it makes 6-8 ez Mac cups I portion and store. I do this with regular pasta too and it can be frozen. || Simce you just like the one brand you could make your own cups. Get the box, divvy it out into single meal portions and try microwaving them. You may need to add starch or something since microwave heating is different || Just be aware parboiled/instant noodles are different from regular macaroni (the latter requires longer cooking although yes microwave is doable), and Easy Mac powder is different from boxed Kraft mac and cheese powder in at least 2 ways: the finished products taste slightly different, and the latter requires milk and butter added. Can vouch for other posters who suggest the Easy Mac pouches; to me they taste the same as Easy Mac cups.

For what it's worth, boxed Cheetos mac and cheese tastes pretty similar to Easy Mac (to me) without the plastic cups. || Agreed with the top comment! Fed is best! As someone with lots of food avoidances and allergies, I know what you are dealing with OP. 

The world doesn't need us all to be perfect. The planet needs us to do what we each can without hurting ourselves. 

You could also re-use the cups for things like starting seeds! || Yes powdered cheese. I think to get the ratio right, you‚Äôll just need to play mad scientist a bit. Even if you keep some of the cups around for your most challenging days, if you could switch to making from bulk ingredients even like half the time, then hey, that‚Äôs awesome progress! || My first thought for white powdered cheese is something I saw at a Amish food market. It was powdered cheddar cheese. Its probably not exactly the same but it might be worth a try. || That white powder is maltodextrin I think which can be bought in bulk, and places like Costco sell the powder in big shakers.

Careers in Zero Waste World,I‚Äôve been thinking about making a career pivot to something more fulfilling that aligns with my values. I was curious if anyone knows of companies in the zero waste/sustainability/clean energy space that have good cultures? ,"Dr. bonners. I hear they have good employee benefit, higher minimum wage etc‚Ä¶ 

Unfortunately all zero waste in India are still at its startup stage and many are non- profit‚Ä¶ 

Have u tried breaking into consulting? Specially in the esg space? 

Other consulting can include for ways of life. One of my acquaintance does consulting for sustainable house build (they engage services for materials, sourcing of build materials, even some amount of design services to keep the carbon footprint low). Another one does zero waste consulting in weddings. It is low scale as they are only advisory.. so more on a project fee basis than a event organiser. They focus on zero waste wedding - sourcing cutlery, zero waste medium of food serving, include closing the loop. Eg: Indian weddings are heavy on food and flowers‚Ä¶ they work with caterers to keep food waste minimum, find tie ups for leftover food to be taken to orphanages or community kitchens where people who can‚Äôt afford food can go and eat a meal, flower waste sorted and sold to those who make essential oils, veggies unused taken to feeding shelters for cows, goats etc‚Ä¶ finally composting of the wet waste produced from celebrations.

So if you are stocking a kitchen for the first time, think about basics. You don't need all the gadgets. A mid-grade knife and wood cutting board will handle most prep. Avoid nonstick cookware--that coating is plastic and will end up in your food. If you haven't already, learn how to make some quick basic meals so you are not tempted to take out.

These changes will save you money plus a whole lot of storage space. || Towels for drying your hands, and separate towels/rags for cleaning (I like flour sack towels). I'm also a big fan of Grove Co cleaning concentrates, but their refillable bottles suck, so buy those elsewhere.¬†


Kitchenware is super thriftable and much lower waste than buying new, but consider lead testing swabs for old glass/ceramic.


Also old school PYREX with the all caps logo is a zillion times more resilient than new pyrex with the lowercase logo || The best zero waste is buying nothing || Get stuff from Goodwill... recycle and reuse!¬† || try not to buy new items. 

make a list of things you need and start visiting local second-hand stores. 

i guarantee you will find 90% of what you need for a fraction of the price. and you won't be consuming more new products, which is \*the\* source of wasted resources and waste generally. 

the few items you can't find, or that the used version of might break, \*then\* purchase new. so many people move into a new place and go spend $500-1000 on various household basics... then most of them are rarely used and end up in the trash or at a second-hand store. skip the consumption and win. || GET A FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Seriously. Many landlords provide them, but please have one on hand. That, and renter's insurance. 

Veggie soap is a scam of a product. Also, get microfiber cloths for cleaning and a spray bottle. You can just use bleach and water together to clean a bathroom. Make a solution and reuse the bottle. 

Get napkins to avoid paper towel use and see if there's compost in your area. || I bought a packet of white huck towels (surgical towels) that I have used for almost six years instead of paper towels/micro fiber rags. They‚Äôre SUPER absorbent and the texture is great for difficult messes. I just chuck a bunch in the wash when the dirty basket of them is full. || Bar soap for showering, and maybe even bar shampoo and conditioner. You can buy cotton or other natural fiber baggies with drawstrings to hang them up and drip dry so they don't get gunky.

When it comes to cleaning cloths, linens, towels, etc, be mindful of what material they're made of. Microplastics shed in the washing machine.

Agreed with others on the quality food containers. Same for cookware and dishware. They don't have to be expensive, necessarily, but if you can be mindful of the materials they're made of and use reviews to shop, you can prevent cheap gear from breaking and ending up in the trash.

If your area's water isn't great, a good filter for the sink or a pitcher for a refillable bottle. If your fridge has a dispenser, make sure to replace the filter periodically to keep your water tasty and clean. 

If you have a dishwasher, use it! But make sure it's loaded efficiently and you're not running it frivolously. 

Don't buy stuff just because you have space to store it! More cabinet space doesn't mean you need every countertop appliance on the market. Try to avoid into the ""it's on sale"" trap, too.

Any food you can feasibly cook from scratch will probably be made of ingredients that are in more eco-friendly containers than buying it pre-made, and they'll be healthier than their more convenient equivalents. You can also get more mileage out of ingredients that you don't use all at once by using them across multiple recipes, like a bag of flour and a packet of yeast, vs. a bag of pre-sliced bread packaged in a plastic bag and full of preservatives. And don't be afraid of leftovers! I've met a surprising number of people (my husband and our roommate, for example) who aren't in the habit of eating leftovers. Leftovers can double as meal prep if you portion appropriately. 

Shop secondhand first! This will serve the dual purposes of saving you some money and keeping things out of landfills. I especially like to check FB Marketplace, Goodwill, etc for furniture and kitchen wares. Plus, Bezos doesn't need my money, so if I can help some internet rando make a few bucks off a used table or something, I'd rather do that when possible. Just exercise caution when you inspect it for cleanliness and whatnot.

Composting can be done in small quantities if you're into gardening/ houseplants, but it's a bit of a chore. Still worth a try, in my opinion. Bigger compost bins are awesome if you have the space, too.

Reusable grocery bags! I have a collection of the type that folds up flat when stored, but with a firm panel you can drop into the bottom when open, and those things are sturdy. They can hold quite a bit of weight, which means you don't have to use as many. Most are washable, as well. Keep one in your car or with your keys or whatever, so you have one in case of pit stops for random supplies. They even make the tiny little foldable ones you can put in a keychain or in a bag.

If you can find a local produce market, some of them can be fairly priced and you're contributing to your local economy while helping minimize mass long distance transit of non-local and/ or out-of-season foods.

Learn basic mending techniques for clothing, bags, etc so you don't have to replace something because of a fixable or patch-able issue. You don't need to be a pro, it just needs to be secure. You can also try to find someone local to do this, too. Minor alterations and repairs are typically not very expensive.

""Best by"" doesn't mean ""throw away after this date."" Case by case, use your senses and judgment to determine whether something has gone bad. If you're using whole ingredients, it's usually easy to tell. If you're unsure, Google it. If you're still unsure, it's okay to toss it. Health and safety are more important.

A bidet attachment isn't terribly expensive, is easy to install, and can be removed easily, so is okay to put in a rental. It'll help cut back on paper usage.

These are just some things off the top of my head that I've tried with mixed results and longevity. Whatever you do or don't try - and I'm not definitely not suggesting you launch into any or all of these at the same time - don't worry if something doesn't work with your lifestyle. You alone are not going to make or break efforts to reduce trash output everywhere. Cut yourself some slack if, like me, you end up abandoning a compost pail because you never managed to work it into your routine. You can always try again, and even if you don't, that's okay, too. Reduce, reuse, recycle, is an order of operations. Reduce your trash output, reuse things when you have something on hand you can use, then recycle if you can't apply the first two.

Hope this helps! Sorry for the wall of text, but hopefully something jumps out and works for you! || - stainless steel cookware over nonstick or ceramic cookware. Stainless steel is one of the safest and most durable options. It will last forever. Now there‚Äôs some learning curve, just look up YouTube on how to pick, how to use and how to clean. Of course, if you can find it second hand, awesome!

- if you don‚Äôt have oily scalp use a facial bar from head to toe: shampooing, facial cleanser and body wash. I would suggest Cetaphil cleansing bars. Yes, they are wrapped in plastic, but still much less plastic and bottle. Plus, they are affordable, gentle yet has enough cleansing power.

- As other has suggested, if you menstruate, GET reusable period products. I found new financial liberation after using menstrual cup/disk and underwear. No one getting money off my menstruation again! Look up Period Nivarna on how to pick a menstrual cup/disk. If you don‚Äôt feel like putting a cup/disk in your body, period underwear is awesome too!

- Some suggested soap nuts, but I disagree. The cleaning ability of soap nuts is very low. If you can afford it, I would suggest Dropps. If not, just get regular powder laundry detergent. Look up Jeeves NY on YouTube, he tested out different brands of laundry detergents. 

- Save a few jars from pickles and what not. Bring them to the refill stations. For marking sauces/dressing. I have a few tiny jam jars to store salt at work. 

- I also saved a few wine/soda bottles, and then got a few wine pourer. Now I have a fancy glass oil bottle/ for cooking.

- when you went out for food, and had the plastic take home containers. I use them for dried goods, beans, dry mushrooms, pasta. Just don‚Äôt use them for hot stuff.

- buy second hand electronics! You don‚Äôt need the latest models! Save you money too! || I love [Oak and Willow](https://www.oakandwillow.store). I use their shampoo and conditioner bars, solid dish soap, loofa sponges/dish brushes/straw brush, laundry detergent, and toilet pods. They are based in Canada so‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre in the US they may not be the best option. 

I also like using [Dr. Bronner‚Äôs](https://www.drbronner.com/pages/dilutions-cheat-sheet-for-castile-soap) for a lot of cleaning stuff. || Look in your college town for a refill/ zero waste store. They usually have all the soaps and deodorants that you can put in old containers.  I have so many glass jars full of random liquids at this point ü§£. The health food stores usually have bulk bins for flour and grains too. 

If you're open to it, get a portable bidet ( they have them for postpartum moms and people with hemeroids) and it will cut down on TP usage ( i carry a wet bag with me with clothes to dry with) 
Also cloth pads for menstruation! You will need to find the cloth that feels best to you but I have found a good cotton as a top layer works best for me. There are a million cloth pad brands and styles. 

Get a bottle/cup that you like (and doesn't leak) and just use that. It also cuts down on washing a million cups. 

Invest in a good backpack/ school bag so you don't have to keep buying. I didn't the first time and now I'm looking for a waterproof one with good straps. 
Good luck! || Join your local Buy Nothing group on Facebook and you‚Äôll be surprised at all the stuff you can score. Everything from furniture to clothing, housewares, appliances‚Ä¶even food.

I‚Äôve also given away a ton of stuff in my group. || Home products that I use instead of disposable alternatives some people reach for:

- chainmail scrubber (replaces disposable scrubbers)

- nylon Ikea dish brush (replaces dish sponges, dishcloths, compostable aka disposable dish brush heads, etc.)

- huck towels (replaces paper towels, sponges, swiffer pads, etc.); cheaper than anything marketed at you as a reusable paper towel and sturdier than flour sack towels, plus it's reclaimed waste

- tabo instead of toilet paper; doesn't require adjusting plumbing in a rental which a bidet would do

- powdered dishwasher detergent from a boring brand like your local store's store brand; comes in a paperboard container and allows you to dose detergent to the reality of your dishes load

- cooking utensils I know how to clean and realistically can put in the effort to clean consistently; wood requires special care, metal cannot be used on nonstick, nylon will melt if left on a hot burner or in a hot pan; match the quirks of the materials to the best fit for your brain so that you don't throw out your cooking utensils from misuse

- a fire extinguisher and working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors; house fire waste is preventable

- a permanent furnace filter, the kind you zip a fabric sock onto a frame and you wash the fabric sock instead of throwing out a furnace filter

- solid laundry detergent sold in compostable container

- soap bars sold in paperboard boxes or sold without wrapping from a local soaper you find at a craft fair or the Farmer's Market

- good quality outside gear so that you can walk more and drive less; be worthy of the saying, ""There's no such thing as bad weather, just inappropriate clothes."" || Omg you‚Äôre literally THE reason i made https://www.revoltcart.com/chrome-extension .

marinating meat with ziplock alternative ideas.,I normally use ziplock bags or offbrand versions since I can squeeze the air out and use less marinated while covering the entire meat. But I tried silicone version and they just are too much of a hassle to clean. I handwash typically and I struggle to even keep them open to dry. Are there any other ideas ya'll have? I would use a glass container but that usually makes me use more marinade then I need and I end up having to waste it. ,"I just use a bowl with a cover || Just use a little more marinade.

Mine is 15 years old and has help up well, perhaps you can find one at an Opportunity shop || Much better to waste a bit of marinade than to use single-use plastic bags. Cheaper, too. Those things should be the first thing you stop buying, along with cling wrap.

I marinate foods in a glass bowl with a glass plate laid on top. Works fine. You can always freeze the leftover marinade as well - just note what kind of meat you used it for. || I end up turning my silicone style bags inside out to wash/dry them. It seems to work better for me YMMV || For silicone bags I just put them through the dishwasher. The dry circle is enough to get it mostly dry.

Eco friendly disposable plates?,"I know this is very counter productive but I don‚Äôt have a dishwasher and I go through very bad phases where I‚Äôm not able to get myself to do dishes. They end up getting piled up and I‚Äôm with no dishes. 

My question is as the title says, are there disposable plates that are eco friendly? Preferably as low cost as it can be.","You have a few options! They make plates and bowls out of fallen palm leaves, bamboo, or just plain paper. I have found them on Amazon or you can even buy in bulk from wholesalers if you‚Äôre feeling fancy, there are a lot of options if you type in ‚Äúbamboo plates disposable‚Äù on google. 

Gotta take care of yourself before you take care of the planet, friend. || I do drop-off composting (definitely don‚Äôt have the spoons for doing it myself!), and living with a chronic illness means I also go through those times. Totally get it, and your struggle is valid. Props to you for wanting to still do right by the planet!

I keep some compostable silverware and plates around‚Äî I just get them from my co-op but the brand is World Centric. Whichever brand you go for, make sure they‚Äôre certified compostable with wherever you‚Äôre going to drop them off if you go with the compost option. Good luck! :) || Compostable plates are eco friendly if you actually compost them. The appeal of compostable plates and cutlery in my opinion is that you can divert some waste from a landfill. 

Single use stuff isn't ideal but I get it. || Great Value (Walmart), Everspring (Target), H‚ÄëE‚ÄëB, and World Centric all make compostable paper plates.

Also, don‚Äôt let anyone here bully you into not taking care of yourself. Obviously the goal is to be as sustainable as you can, but your physical well-being is more important. And if you ever feel bad about that, just look at Taylor Swift‚Äôs private jet flights. || I cannot stress this enough, but an ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù disposable plate is not going to be any more sustainable than a normal disposable plate. If your intention is throwing them away into a garbage bag and sending it off to a landfill, it will not decompose at all.

I also used to get into bad boughts with doing the dishes. One trick I‚Äôve learned is to just wash as many as you can while you have the microwave running‚Äîit‚Äôs just killing time while you wait for whatever‚Äôs in there, so it kind of helped incentivize doing them. || I really want to plant a few banana trees to use the leaves this way occasionally. They also are great food wraps. || I‚Äôve used compostable paper plates for years. I use them as mulch in the garden afterwards so they get reused and are put to work another way. Typically I will lay them face down around plants and put wood mulch on top. It helps keep in moisture and kills weeds. Hope this helps || Depending on what must be contained in it you can use fruit shells that you ate the interiors of already, I do this sometimes on my hate washing dishes days.


Also this isn't about disposables but if you aren't responsible for anyone *else's* dishes you can honestly get away with just using the same refrigerated dish without anything more than a quick water wash leaving minor food stains as they are multiple times. I've done that using one bowl for six meals straight before, no sickness. Same goes for drinks.


You can also eat directly from a noncoated steel pot/pan and disinfect just boiling water on it so long as there's no annoyingly stubborn scraps to deal with which is also something I do to reduce dishes, this is easier if you use smaller pots/pans than I do (restaurant supply store behemoths...) || Interesting :Listing for Wooden Palm Leaf Plate on Temu says:

Cloth TP,Hi guys! I‚Äôm currently working on slowly switching over to sustainable options as I use up what I have now. I‚Äôm wondering if the benefits of cloth toilet paper and a bidet are worth it. My only concern is the amount of water that will be used by having to do laundry more frequently and using the bidet. Does it even out with the waste of toilet paper is it still better? ,"I will tell every soul I come across that a bidet is the best purchase you will EVER make. You feel so much cleaner and use way less toilet paper. 1000% recommend. || I second that a bidet is worth every penny. I personally believe that laundering cloth would use less resources than producing, shipping and disposing of toilet paper with the caveat that you were using green energy and environmentally friendly laundry products. However, I thought the same would be true of cloth nappies versus disposable and the differences appear to be negligible.

When I was faced with this question I asked myself what I‚Äôm more comfortable with. The mental load of adding to my laundry helped make the decision that toilet paper still has a place in my household. The compromise being TP used for number one is put in a bin to be composted and TP for number two is flushed. The thought experiment allowed me to be more intentional with the toilet paper I buy. We aim for recycled TP, packaged in paper. I will say having toilet paper on hand is a must for when the ever feared stomach bugs are going around and for guests who might not feel comfortable with something new. 

I hope you‚Äôll be realistic with yourself and keep in mind the following ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let perfect be the enemy of good‚Äù. || I'm already using a washing machine, and I make a load of flannel wipes from the toilet (they're not very dirty since we have a bidet,) absorbent panties, and handkerchiefs. That's just one load of ""hazardous waste"" per week.

Cutting down on toilet paper saves a great deal of space as well as money. If you're using TP you feel like you have to be stocked up for emergencies and take advantage of sales. If you switch to flannel cloths (plus shop towels for paper towels) you can save several cubic feet of space. || Making toilet paper uses waaaaaaay more water than an additional load of laundry will. || My cloth tp goes in and out of style in my house. I don‚Äôt use a bidet yet, so I only ever use it for #1 and paper tp has always been around for #2. Having cloth TP around offers me peace of mind. The pandemic revealed to me how dependent I was on complex supply chains, and I feel more secure knowing that tp wont be a problem for me should we find history repeating itself. So maybe go with a hybrid mentality! :) || I made a bunch of flannel wipes and just throw them in with other laundry. It hardly adds bulk and they're actually not very dirty since they're only used post-bidet. All this talk of sanitizing... do you sanitize your underwear with every wash? They're at least as ""dirty"" as bidet wipes... || We use cloth toilet paper. || 20 years ago when I got seriously into gardening I switched to a bidet as well as a sawdust toilet and absolutely loved it. I'm in an apartment now so I don't have a compost bin or a way to compost but I definitely still use cloth and a bidet. It's wonderful not to contribute to so much toilet paper and so many trees being cut down. || Depending on how zero waste you want to go, a tumbler is just as useful as a bidet. You'd just fill it in the bathroom sink before you sit down to do business. Or if you have a small bathroom like me, I can even just reach over to the side and fill it in the sink after I sit down. || I've been doing this for about 10 years. It's a huge money saver. I make my own, along with wet bags to store the used pieces. The only time I have used TP at home since I installed my bidet is when my pipes froze in January. I have TP for guests only. 

As for the wash, I've accumulated a LOT of family cloth over the years (I just make more when I have flannel scraps). I typically wash it every 3 weeks or so when I'm close to running out.

Zero waste garbage and recycling bins for home,"I am looking for litter bins for my new home (garbage, recycling, the compost bin) and I am having trouble finding even the most basic 100% postconsumer recycled plastic ones, let alone plastic free stainless steel or other metal options. I wonder if anyone has found any sustainable options to share? I am in Canada. Thanks! ","Thrift! I've generally found home goods like that at the Goodwill (yes, I know, prefer small local shops). || Friend you want the simplehuman brand. I replaced all my bins in the house with their recyclers. The bins are stainless steel, inner buckets are 100% PCR. They also make a composter. || Lee Valley has good small steel buckets. That's what my family always used for compost. Put it in the bin, and then dump it in the compost pile by the garden. 

My house came with large plastic recycling bins that I use for most things, but I've also gotten small wire garbage cans for other rooms around the house from both Dollarama, and thrift stores. Another perhaps strange idea, is that when I moved in, there was also a fabric laundry basket being used as a recycling bin. I can't recommend it for anything that could get it dirty, but it's a great idea for dry things like paper.",2,ZeroWaste,2025-05-03 02:25:37,zero waste garbage recycling bins home,looking litter bins new home garbage recycling compost bin trouble finding even basic postconsumer recycled plastic ones let alone plastic free stainless steel metal options wonder anyone found sustainable options share canada thanks,thrift generally found home goods like goodwill yes know prefer small local shops friend want simplehuman brand replaced bins house recyclers bins stainless steel inner buckets pcr also make composter lee valley good small steel buckets family always used compost put bin dump compost pile garden house came large plastic recycling bins use things also gotten small wire garbage cans rooms around house dollarama thrift stores another perhaps strange idea moved also fabric laundry basket used recycling bin recommend anything could get dirty great idea dry things like paper
what's the hardest part of going zero waste that no one warned you about?,"there are tons of tips online about zero waste swaps-metal straws, shampoo bars, reusable bags. But no one really talks about how hard it can be to stick with it in real life","For me it was changing my consumerist mindset. Going from buying a lot of plastic stuff to buying a lot of glass/metal/wood stuff is still wasteful af. || It's hard to be zero waste 100% of the time. I tried, and still try, to do my best, but I've learned to give myself grace. It's all about balance. If I have to get a plastic bag for some reason, I'll save it and use it to pick up trash somewhere. 

If there are some things that are really easy for you to do, stick with those. But don't beat yourself up if someone gives you a piece of candy that you really want but is in a non-recyclable wrapper, or if someone gives you a plastic straw. We're all intermingled on this planet and it's really hard to do anything without the influence of others. If everyone just did a little bit more, it'd go further than if a few of us did 100% zero waste. || Hardest thing is the kitchen! So many of the swaps are for the bathroom, but they are for items you don‚Äôt even throw away that often, like shampoo. It‚Äôs really hard to grocery shop zero waste, and most of my trash is produced in the kitchen. || When your kid starts school and their friends all bring packaged snacks and they want them too. You explain why we don‚Äôt buy them and then they demand you talk to other parents about single use plastics and ask why these other adults don‚Äôt care. 

We do eat some packaged foods too so we aren‚Äôt perfect but I draw the line on individually wrapped single servings. || You will be sabotaged by family and friends. || Hardest part of being zero waste/ eco friendly is being chronically ill, have sensory issues/ sensory processing disorder and an artist 

Makes it hard to do some switches that healthy people are able to do

Also since I am sick I am all time seeing ableism in zero waste/ eco friendly/ plastic free groups/ environments groups where people say things and not even think for second how it affect the chronically sick people. Which is annoying. 

It also annoying all posts I see where people like should I do this health care treatment still cause it comes in plastic for example or bragging about making a recipe for sun screen or toothpaste (that doesn‚Äôt actually protect you/ keep you healthy) 

Like please people keep doing your health treatments unless doctors tell you to stop, please don‚Äôt diy products that won‚Äôt actually do any good and or hurt your health instead. Just buy the product so you know your doing what best for your health.

Sometimes the health posts (you know type that saying I made my own toothpaste, or I use beef fat as sunscreen for example) makes me want to leave these groups. Cause it hard seeing people actively hurting there health when there 90% of the time healthy when I been chronic ill from birth basically. But I don‚Äôt cause outside of health related posts you can find a lot of good information. || Packaging. I try to buy in bulk and refill where I can, but packaging is so unavoidable. I compost and recycle whatever I can so the only thing we actually put in the trash is usually single-use plastic packaging, which really makes it noticeable. Also glossy junk mail that goes straight from the box to the trash without ever being looked at. It's 95% of my mail at this point and it's so frustrating (but I know junk mail funds the USPS, just wish they could make it more sustainable by mandating different papers and inks). || The prep work. 
If I want granola without plastic I have to make it. Cereal is almost impossible to get plastic free. Crackers, cheese (unless you buy a whole wheel), chips. Snacks are near impossible. So are berries. Nobody talks about how much more time you have to put into making things from scratch with ingredients instead of the ease of just buying it premade. || Honestly? The hardest part is staying motivated when convenience always wins. It‚Äôs not that people don‚Äôt want to reduce waste ‚Äî it‚Äôs that the systems around us are built for disposability.

That‚Äôs why I started trading more. Swapping clothes or home stuff with people near me feels way more sustainable and satisfying than just buying less. We‚Äôve got so much already ‚Äî we just need better ways to circulate it. || Honestly, some peeps make it sound so easy like use cloth napkins for example. Well between 3 kids, pets, and working full time that extra load of laundry might put me over the edge some days. So yes I then reach for the paper towels. Also a lot of low/zero waste like finding better options for toothpaste, seem to mean no fluoride. Sorry I want fluoride. Or I'd love an actual antiperspirant not deodorant that is eco friendly. || The incessant need to be perfect about zero waste is actually impossible to achieve and it's okay if you use wasteful products because it's the only thing available or accessible.

I don't know if this is at all relatable, but I've got OCD and one theme of it is moral/ethics OCD and I used to genuinely feel like the world's worst planet killer when I'd use something like a liquid IV or drink from a plastic water bottle someone offered me when I've been dehydrated (i am chronically dehydrated, i am often in desperate need of electrolytes even after drinking lots of water). Little things like that have made me question if I actually cared about being low waste and care about the environment.... And then I remember that I literally need things to survive sometimes and my footprint is much smaller than others. || Snacks for the kid.

I absolutely pack some into reusable bags but having things available to run out the door for a bike ride with no notice comes in handy. So I try to find a balance. || I find honestly other people's judgement - and I don't mean in the zero waste circles, I mean generally. If you spend enough time reading about zero waste and following zero waste bloggers, you'll have seen enough videos telling you not to be influenced, and that a little bit is better than nothing, etc, so I don't feel too much judgement from the community. But where I live it isn't really a thing, or it isn't particularly cool or trendy. I used to be in a big city and no one cared about what I did, and if people noticed, they always just said about how they should do more themselves, etc. Here, in a mid/small city, it's just weird. People don't get why I buy second hand clothes; my mother in law (when we moved and stayed at her house) was horrified when she found out I use re-usable period pads (which I washed separately!) - my mum is very environmentally conscious and said she found it weird because when she was young it was such a big thing when you could use something disposable and convenient. People around me mostly limit their zero-waste effort at bringing a water bottle; anything beyond that is a bit weird and considered a bit extreme. That's what I find hard. I am not someone with an incredible confidence or self-esteem and so many times I feel a bit silly re-wearing clothes to events or having something that looks visibly mended rather than brand-new. || Honestly, just how much people don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm not 0 waste, but probably 90% since I was 21 and I‚Äôm now 28z I‚Äôve had so many people that I‚Äôve known for years, say things like just use this disposable plate, instead of normal plates. Or here‚Äôs a water (plastic water bottle) I have to remind them all the time ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use that.‚Äù I have this line I say  to parents ‚Äú I‚Äôm using the reusable one for your kids future, because I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm not going to have any.‚Äù Then they feel guilty || What your municipality recycles is not the same as what is actually recyclable. || For me it's finding a comparative product that works. I'm not about to diy a cleaning product - I am not a chemical engineer, plenty of those people have perfected safe and stable solutions. It's trying to get those same products in bulk.

Some swaps are easy, like vinegar as fabric softener and glass cleaner, cascade powder for the dishwasher, etc. but the laundry strips and some of the ""laundry powder"" or ""stain remover powder"" sold in zero waste stores is, chemically, basically just baking soda and does not get clothes clean. I've tried wool dryer balls for static and they just don't work. Same with the bar dish soap. 

So I buy as much as I can in bulk from Costco (oxyclean powder, laundry detergent, pinesol/dawn dish soap in the huge jug, etc). || I'm just starting my waste reduction journey, but so far what has been most difficult is just that I have ADHD. Reusables are another thing I have to remember. Bulk buying means I have to bring jars and bags to the store to actually reduce waste (I live a five minute bike ride from a store with a large bulk section, I'm extremely privileged in this reguard). Sometimes I can't do my laundry until I am literally out of clothes. Reducing food waste is hard bc I forget food exists no matter how hard I try and it rots in my fridge (I'm hoping to get compost to help reduce my impact in this area). This stuff is hard for everyone, but having ADHD amplifies, especially for me bc all my executive dysfunction points got dumped into ""home"".


I'm also an ethical vegan which intersects in some difficult ways with low waste. I won't buy anything that comes from an animal. I'm still trying to decide how comfortable I am with secondhand leather (ethically I'm okay with it, I just don't know yet how I personally feel about wearing the skin of a previously living creature).  A shocking amount of low-waste alternatives contain some amount of animal product, especially locally made body care products that I can get refills of (I found a wonderful local soap but it was made using beef tallow :( ). This stuff isn't the same issue if you're plant-based for purely environmental reasons.


If anyone's has any tips I'll take them tbh. This stuff has HANDS || Consumerism is so prevalent that it leaks into the eco conscious communities quite well because of green washing and cultural appropriation. In some of my local circles people want to talk down on others who may have a need for items that are single use plastic or something that isn't glass/bamboo/metal¬†but will then show off literal hauls of green washed items in the name of natural and eco-friendly.


In 2020 I watched a ""documentary"" on hygiene products. Afterwards I wanted to immediately go scent free, plastic free, single use free, and even vegan all within a small time frame and what ended up happening is that I spent more money on things that I didn't need. On top of that, some of the stuff I splurged on after going through a panic purge just were not quality or effective, like cleaning supplies and hygiene products. It resulted in double the usage and thus more money I spent. Eco-friendly/low waste cleaners are great till norovirus ravages the house.¬†

If I could go back and give myself advice it would be to have active thinking when trying to cut down my waste instead of listening to bloggers who fear monger plastic cutting boards and deodorant, and who also happen to have affiliate links in their bios.¬† || Hoarding tendencies. Including ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to dispose of this the best way, guess I won‚Äôt,‚Äù and ‚Äúsurely this will come in handy someday,‚Äù and ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs such a nice bottle/box/trinket!‚Äù || It's the food products. Everything comes in plastic. I lead a busy life - I don't feel I have time to ONLY shop at the farmer's market and never buy frozen peas in a plastic bag from the grocery store, you know? And for other things like bread, I'm not going to bake my own sandwich bread (I have tried many times, and I also HATE cooking/baking, so it's like a punishment) or go to an artisanal bakery that

Bidet?,"I just restocked our toilet paper and it made me wonder if a bidet is worth it. I love the idea of reducing the need for an ongoing paper product we buy, but does a bidet just become one more thing to clean, maintain and eventually dispose of?","Once you go bidet, you never go back. || We use a bidet with reusable toilet paper in my house, it works for us and the bidet is nearly ten years old. I clean it when I clean the toilet. I think the factor for making sure it's not JUST future trash is evaluating your lifestyle to determine if it's something you'd realistically use as well as buying a model you can maintain. Heated water and a bunch of features sounds nice, but that's more that can potentially (and eventually will) break.

Some people will not do bidet or reusable toilet paper and I think that's ok. Make the changes you want to make, we can't do everything. The worst thing we can do is buy stuff for a romanticized version of ourselves in our mind and then... not use it. || YES IT IS!!! Even for non zero waste purposes... we moved into a house with one for the first time two years ago and I refuse to use either of the other toilets now. Don't know how we lived without one for so long. Maintenance is easy -- I just wipe it down when I am cleaning the rest of the toilet. || Bought our bidet during covid and about 70 flannel wipes. We love it! Have only bought one 4pk of TP since 2020 - for guests.  Love the savings & never dealing with a clogged toilet! || It‚Äôs worth it. I‚Äôve considered buying one for my dad‚Äôs house and my in-laws for when we come visit. TP only feels gross to me now.¬† || I have a small shower head fixed on the water going to the tank. cost was minimal, it also helps with cleaning the toilet itself.

since people talked about it I should say that it's not heated but it was never a problem for me (yeah even in winter with real cold weather. || It is. 110%. || It is very worth it. We bought ours before lockdown and rarely had to buy TP. There are too many pros to ever go back.   
  
The ones we have don't need cleaning that often. Some bidets ""clean"" themselves with a spritz after each use as they retract.

>The short answer is yes, bidets are more sustainable than toilet paper. They save trees and, surprisingly, they save water, too.

>Unless you live in a water-scarce environment, bidets win over toilet paper because spritzing your bum uses far less water than wiping it. Here‚Äôs some conservative math: A typical bidet uses about one-eighth of¬†a gallon of water per-flush. A single roll of standard forest fiber toilet paper requires six gallons. (Recycled toilet paper uses about three gallons). So one roll of standard toilet paper, which lasts my family of four¬†*maybe*¬†two days, equals 48 bidet sprays. If we each spray twice a day, that means a bidet uses 33.3 percent less water. || Yes, but having tried both I personally have a strong preference for the handheld version that hangs on the side of the tank vs. one that‚Äôs installed at the back of the seat.  IME/O that version just creates more crevices that can‚Äôt fully be cleaned unless you disassemble, and realistically that‚Äôs not gonna happen often enough.  The handheld one is also more maneuverable, and easy to rinse front to back should that be necessary.  I still use toilet paper, but less. || I feel much cleaner with a bidet though I still use toilet paper to dry off. I haven't compared how much tp I used before/after getting a bidet attachment but I would think it's less. || I think it worth it. Cold water is not as surprizing as I thought. I still use tp but I also think I use less. You end up pretty wet down there tho so it's kinda a pain to dry with tp.

For cleaning, pretty easy, they have a cleaning mode and I just wipe the bidet inside when I wash the toilet. 

Make sure you are well sit on the toilet when using the bidet too. It spray pretty far! || Do it. You'll wonder why you didn't do it sooner. || As a person who suffers from IBS-D, getting a bidet was a godsend! I will say I do still use a bit of paper to dry off, even though mine has a warm air dryer. You need to sit there a really long time to get fully dry and I don't like wet underpants. So I dry as much as possible and then use a little bit of paper to pat dry. It's a lot less paper than before. || Bidet is the way. || Bidet + a large stack of small hand towels =  so luxurious! || I have the Tushy. The bidet is wonderful, I‚Äôm not a huge fan of cleaning the part that attaches to the toilet/seat. || It doesn‚Äôt take much cleaning. Presumably you are already cleaning your toilet with a disinfectant every so often. Just wipe the bidet when you clean the toilet. If you use a hose kind, it‚Äôs even easier. If you get an attachment style one, I recommend the brand LUXE because you can flip it up 90 degrees to clean it. || You're so close to changing your life, all you have to do is click the button... *buy the bidet* || A cheap $2 peri bottle will last a decade or more and do the same job as a bidet. || My husband was so hesitant to get one thinking it was a waste of money. We got one right before covid lock downs. He‚Äôs the first complain if he had to poop at work, he calls them peasant shits. 

And we just get the cheap $20 add ons since we rent. Super easy to install and we just remove it and throw it away if we move. We‚Äôve only had to do that once. But so far we used each for 3 years.

Apartment essentials,"Hi! So I‚Äôm about to move out to my new apartment (a small one, less than 30m2). It will be completely new so I‚Äôd like to ask you what are the essentials that will help me be zero waste? 
I will live with my boyfriend and there is no balcony. And right now it‚Äôs during complete renovation so I‚Äôll appreciate all ideas :)

P.s sorry for my English, it‚Äôs not my first language ","Kitchen tools, pans, pots, cutting boards, knives. Anything that incentivizes you to cook and eat at home more.

  
Besides that, just be very careful with what you bring into the home because the first step to being zero waste is to limit consumption. || Rags instead of paper towels is the biggest saver for me || Buy quality when you can where it counts the most (possible w/ Thrift stores and discount stores like marshalls, grocery outlet, or similar for your area etc.) To avoid buying again in the future.¬† Low quality pots/pans/knives will need to be rebought but high quality ones can last a lifetime. Knives i might prioritize for some higher spending as quality ones are harder to find discounted/used. You only really need a chef's knife, a paring knife, a bread knife,¬† and a couple of steak knives (prioritize spending for the chef's knife,¬† the rest can be meh)


Stainless steel and cast iron pans are found in Thrift stores and can last forever.¬† A ceramic pan¬† makes a sturdier (and cleaner) non-stick than Teflon and are affordable at discount stores.¬†¬†


Ceramic dishes are essentially the same risk of breaking if you buy them at the dollar store, Thrift store,¬†¬†or a fancy kitchen store.¬† But cheap silverware is so thin it bends over time- good Thrift store candidate


You can find lots of small appliances at Thrift stores too, and they're rarely made to last either way except for specific blenders and mixers. You can find good brands on r/buyitforlife. Only get appliances you know you will use,¬† most people have a ton they used a couple of times then shoved in a cabinet.¬†


Things you can refill and concentrated cleaners, soaps, etc. You don't need a lot- dish/hand soap, laundry detergent (get real detergent, homemade stuff will break washing machines because you can't make detergent at home, only soap), bleach, vinegar, and baking soda can do about 99% of what you need and can be purchase in bulk.¬†


Washable dish sponges (they also make biodegradable ones,¬† washable ones are plastic so pick your poison)¬†


Don't put Tupperware through a dishwasher and the cheap stuff will last for wayyyyyy longer.¬† May or may not apply. Even for sturdy glass tupperware, the plastic lids get ruined by the dishwasher over time.¬†¬†


I got some silicone covers to use instead of plastic wrap from here:¬†https://zerowasteoutlet.com/products/stretchy-bowl-lids


They have lots of stuff but it can get pricey and better to buy from a local store if you can.¬†


A mop that's reusable but you will actually use. They make what is essentially a swiffer mop but with a refillable tank and washable mop pads now, but you may have to look around to find one or buy online.¬† The heads of most other mops will need replacement/are annoying to use.¬†


If you like dryer sheets, you can get dryer balls


If you like laundry softener, you can try using vinegar in the softener compartment if that's an option on the washing machine available (i like it better!!! Better for your clothes and washer, you only need a little. Don't use concentrated!)¬†

If you like plants and have a sunny window,¬† greens require a lot of plastic packaging but are quick and easy to grow at home.¬†


If you have a bulk store option, containers for bulk food!!! But also i recommend storing pantry food in sealed containers either way because pantry moths suck and you will have to throw a lot of food away and then buy containers in order to get rid of them.¬†


Don't forget a plunger lol, and on a similar note, the first item you move into the apartment should be toilet paper.¬† || Buy one high end item not four mediocre items (ie. One chef‚Äôs knife for 200 not a knife set for 200, one mixing spoon not a set even if it costs the same). 
 
A good set of clear glass food storage containers. Opaque or solid colored and you won‚Äôt see what you have which leads to food waste. 

Only go into home good stores or sections for a specific item and leave with that item only. Stores style isles to make things look better, that lamp looks cute and you will use it but it won‚Äôt look as cute when it‚Äôs not sitting with the whole set and you didn‚Äôt need it before you saw it. 

Look around and see if there‚Äôs a composting service in your area to reduce food waste! || I've always kept a worm box under the sink, even in small apartments they're manageable. I'll add anything I think of, good luck! üïØüññ || You can make reusable dryer sheets and diy detergent (plus a ton of other cleaning stuff) 

Maybe a little indoor compost

You can decorate with thrift stores, estate sales, flea markets etc. may take longer but it will be cheaper (and you can find some really nice stuff if you‚Äôre patient)

Stainless steel lasts long (so does cast iron) but it may cheaper to find non-stick and in that case don‚Äôt use metal utensils on it. 

Look at overstock stores for a mattress

You can still have plenty of indoor plants, whether that‚Äôs some that are pretty or for food

That‚Äôs all I can think of off the top of my head rn || Some things that I really live by... 

* Microfiber cloths for both cleaning and washing my face. I bought a pack that came with 3 colors; 2 colors are exclusive for skincare and 1 color is exclusive for cleaning. (Mine are super old - but if I were to replace them, I would replace them with cotton alternatives due to microplastic concerns. But the same principle applies!!)
* DIY Dropcloth ""napkins"" in place of paper towels. I have bought 3 rolls of paper towels over the past 4 years because I draw the line at dog vomit - otherwise, turning painting dropcloth into napkins has covered all of my paper towel needs.
* Dryer balls have completely replaced dryer lint sheets. I use concentrated powder detergent - the liquid stuff is mostly water.
* A drying rack - I use my dryer, but some of my nicer clothes always get hung to dry to help them stay nice, and it's also super useful for small loads of laundry to just skip the dryer altogether.
* I thrifted a ton of tupperware, and also Pyrex dishes with lids. Plastic is for bringing to work (less weight), and glass or Pyrex are for storing leftovers at home.

One of my favorite things about living in an apartment has been the dumpster area. I know that sounds ridiculous, but people here put nice things off to the side when they move out.

Biodegradeable vs. compostable. Which one is actually better for the environment long-term?,"Hey guys, I keep seeing 'biodegradeable' and 'compostable' used interchangeably on product-packaging, but they're not the same right?

For long-term environmental impact (especially if waste isn't sorted correctly), is one clearly better than the other?

Would love to hear from you folks who work in waste management, sustainability, or packaging. 

Thanks!","I think another commenter perfectly broke down the differences between the two - it comes down to which option is beneficial for the soil let's say. A compostable product will sooner or later turn into ""food"" for the soil.   
  
I personally used the leftovers from some [wool envelopes](https://www.woola.io/wool-envelopes) packaging that I received (it's from the brand of the same name, woola) for my plants. The wool acts as a slow-release fertilizer and helps with soil structure and water retention. It's great to use for gardening but the possibilities are endless. || Biodegradation is a much longer process. Plastic bags are biodegradable, but not compostable. Compostable items can go into regular trash. Biodegradable items cannot go into to waste that‚Äôs getting composted. 

Ideally, you should minimize the amount of packaging altogether, choose reusable packaging (and actually reuse it). If reusable isn‚Äôt an option, prioritize compostable and actually compost it. || Compostable generally means that the material will rot and can be turned into nutrients for the soil within a specific timeframe (including PLA, the clear-plastic that claims to be compostable but requires a strenuous process and is really just junk food for the composter/no nutritional value). Composting can be done in backyards, with worm bins (vermicomposting), or commercial digesters. Cities and counties offer different levels of composting due to the level of digesters (based on temperature and time).

Biodegradable just means that the material is bio based and CAN breakdown over time (can be decades) and likely has zero nutritional value for the soil. || Compostable.

Biodegradable = it'll get so small we won't be able to see it, the made of carbon edition. (Weathered is the made of silica edition.)

I also use Souper cubes to freeze then put the cubes of food into gallon ziploc bags, and then I wash and reuse the ziploc bags until they‚Äôre in poor shape.  Also, if the type of food allows (ie loose things), I freeze on sheet trays then put into a mason jar or ziploc bag depending on the food.

I went with this loaf because of this note,I also love their clear instructions on how to dispose of it.,"OP, you made a good decision with the information available. This would be better than a conventional plastic bag.

That being said, the company here is stretching the truth. ASTM D5511 talks about facilitated anaerobic biodegredation, but the print claims the bag will break down naturally in a landfill. Those are very different conditions. The non-plant based parts of the bag aren't going to degrade if it's traditional PE. You can't have a compostable product that's also recyclable with plastics. This is coming from someone that has experience in the biopolymer industry. Like another poster said, this is greenwashing. || I started baking my own bread because of the bags. Been doing it for like 10 years now. One loaf, every other day. || So if the plant-based plastic breaks down in the landfill, that will create methane. And it will just leave behind microplastics. || But it still has 36% plastic? This is just greenwashing || This seems misleading. LDPE is just plastic - polythene.

Honestly, I'd consider reporting this as greenwash. || I had understood from an article way back that even the 100% compostable bags won't compost in a landfill because they are buried too deep and therefore the conditions are too cold and dry.

How to avoid microplastics in leggings,"I just found out about how your body can absorb microplastics especially from leggings and tight clothing. Usually i go underwear free in leggings, so thinking of purchasing cotton underwear to at least put a barrier between me and my leggings. It seems rash to throw away all my leggings (especially since a lot of them are lulu + expensive!!) but wondering if there is another work around to not absorb so much of the plastics coming from the leggings.","I think that microplastics being shed in the water when you wash them is probably a way bigger problem, honestly. If you're worried about it, wearing some cotton undies is fine. When your leggings wear out, replace them with something better. || If you breathe anywhere near a road or if you eat processed food or artificial / real sugar, thats worse for you than your leggings. Youre fine. Dont throw out your leggings and be more careful with what you buy next time. Buy second hand and donate if possible. || So you know about and use the PlanetCare filter on your clothes washer (if you have one)? It does a good job of filtering out the microplastics in the water from the washer.

I thought you needed a very select number of solvents to move things through the skin barrier?).

Most likely if you are in the USA it'll be heart disease.

my journey into zero waste started with just une mason jar-and now my lifestyle looks different,i used to think zero waste meant being perfectly plastic-free and making everything from scratch. i felt overwhelming. But it all started with one small switch: storing leftovers in a mason jar instead of plastic containers,"I love this message! Perfection is the enemy of progress, and baby steps is how we get there. I'm far from being zero waste myself, but over the years I've made a handful of switches to really reduce my consumption and negative environmental impact! And it feels good! || Zero waste is one of least favorite terms. It‚Äôs pretty unobtainable and not sustainable to manage long term. Even buying from bulk bins, most likely the containers they use at the store to fill those is going to be plastic. 

With that said, every little change you can make, makes a difference in the long run. My partner and I have made a lot of changes once we‚Äôve used something up completely. 

Solid dish soap has been great, using dr bronners castile soap for foaming hand dispensers, mopping liquid, etc (it has so many uses and goes super far) it may come in a plastic bottle but because you can use it for so many things it at least lessons the amount of products you buy in plastic bottles. 

We‚Äôre definitely far from perfect but we have lessened the amount of trash we produce and it feels good to know we try our best in a world that‚Äôs pretty focused on consumption. || Great message! It's starts with one thing you can reduce consumption of, if that ends up being the only change you can make, that's still way better than most. Mine started with paper products. I stopped buying paper towels and toilet paper. || One of the things that I get regularly from the dollar tree is pink Himalayan salt food grade. I rarely open packages with my hands because of medical problems and when I was using the scissors to cut off the zipper portion I realized I could reuse these bags as legitimate zipper bags but right now everybody‚Äôs doing the drink bags and I thought I bet you I could freeze and do smoothie bags and the salt containers. I know it‚Äôs minuscule, but it‚Äôs one less thing that I‚Äôm purchasing one less thing that‚Äôs getting put in the bin whether you recycle or not it‚Äôs still a process. But also one of the few things that the price hasn‚Äôt gone up on and it‚Äôs like six dollars for the same exact thing at Walmart, which is pretty much the cheapest of same and just nuts.

What if your shipping box was the recycling bin? [Concept idea + looking for feedback],"Hey everyone! I had an idea that I‚Äôd love some feedback on‚Äîespecially from those in logistics, packaging, sustainability, or just folks who care about reducing waste.

What if major retailers printed simple, universally-understandable instructions on their boxes to help customers turn them into recycling bins?

The idea is:

* Instead of tossing your shipping box or needing a separate bin, you follow a few visual steps to convert the box into a recycling container.
* The box includes icons of what‚Äôs recyclable (plastic, paper, metal, glass) so it‚Äôs educational too.
* There‚Äôs a safety disclaimer about scissors and kids.
* It‚Äôs designed to be language-agnostic, so it works globally.



Attached images:

1. A mock-up of what the instructional box could look like.
2. What boxes look like now (Walmart + Chewy examples).
3. A ‚Äúrecycled‚Äù Chewy box already being reused as a makeshift bin‚Äîkind of showing how people already do this unofficially.



I‚Äôm curious:

* Would this idea be useful in your home?
* Any suggestions to improve it?
* Is this worth pitching to companies or manufacturers?
* Anyone in the supply chain or packaging world want to collaborate on taking it further?

Open to feedback, collaboration, or even just sharing this to help it grow!","I appreciate your effort, but this seems like instructions on how to use a box as a box. Perhaps adding cutting/folding instructions for other creative ways to use it, something that folks wouldn't normally think of? For example a kid's toy or an animal or a book/phone stand or something. || I don‚Äôt really get the instructions. What do you cut? I‚Äôm guessing cut the flaps off? It looks like the instructions are closed box ‚Äî> cut ‚Äî> open box. Why not just fold the flaps in for an easier process? I feel like most people interested in this sort of thing will just kind of do it on their own. Maybe providing it as an idea (‚Äúthis box makes a great recycle bin!‚Äù) or a list of ideas. Also I‚Äôm really wary of anything a company sends that tries to tell me what to recycle. We should only be recycling what our local facility accepts regardless of what theoretically could be recycled in general. || I'm going to be honest. Eveyone knows you can use a box as a storage container. || So every time you get something shipped the box is supposed to be your new recycling bin? This is silly. I only need one. || Who is your audience for this? In my area the the recycling program picks up cardboard folded or cut down to size, and they'll even pick up a box or paper bag neatly filled with recyclables which I think is quite generous of them. No bin is necessary. Now I know that recycling isn't as effective as we wish, but this wouldn't move the needle on participation or processing in my community. || What is this ChatGPT slop I‚Äôm sorry || What are you cutting here? Just fold the flaps in if you want them out of the way || I don‚Äôt quite understand the purpose, don‚Äôt people already have city-issued recycle bins? || My city doesn‚Äôt accept anything that‚Äôs not in an official bin so it would all end up taken with regular trash. They also require boxes to be broken down so if it was put in a bin like that they wouldn‚Äôt take it. || In what way does this improve anything at all? || Hey everyone, thank you so much for the responses. I‚Äôve read through every single comment, and whether you supported the idea or pushed back on it, I really appreciate the honesty.

To address a few things up front, yes, I used AI to help mock this up and get the idea out of my head. I‚Äôm not a designer, and I wanted something visual to explain the concept more clearly. It wasn‚Äôt about trying to make it look futuristic or gimmicky, I just wanted a quick way to show what I was thinking.

I get that using a box as a box isn‚Äôt groundbreaking. A lot of people already do that. But what I‚Äôm aiming for is a shift in mindset. We ship millions of boxes every day and most get tossed right away, even though there‚Äôs still life left in them. With just a little intention, those same boxes could be repurposed into something more useful or even fun.

Imagine if companies like Chewy, Walmart, or Amazon treated their boxes as more than packaging. They could add a few printed folds or icons that show you how to turn the box into a cat fort, a recycling bin, a toy, a desk organizer, or a returns box. It wouldn‚Äôt cost much, and it could become a new standard that encourages people to reuse instead of toss.

I know this wouldn‚Äôt be useful to everyone, especially in places where recycling is already well established or where rules are super specific. But for people in apartments or places without proper bins, or just folks who like the idea of creative reuse, I think it could actually help.

So I want to take this further and evolve the idea into something real. If you‚Äôre into packaging, logistics, sustainability, or just enjoy creative projects, I‚Äôd love to connect.

What would make this idea actually useful where you live? Or better yet, what else could a box become? Let‚Äôs build something better together. || I give it a 1-in-5 chance of being picked up by my local recycling trucks.  They are picky about how they accept things.  This can only be global if you work with individual waste collection services to make sure they'll recognize it. || You don‚Äôt even need scissors. I use a cardboard box from our grocery shipments for the recycles every week. Just fold the flaps inward! || I already do that with cardboard? I have a box of broken down boxes separate from the rest of my recycling because it fills up the whole bin. || I don‚Äôt think it help much cause most people who don‚Äôt recycle are either chronically ill/ disable and can‚Äôt, or live in an area where you have to pay to recycle items or have drive to a place to drop off recycling if they don‚Äôt pay for it which most aren‚Äôt gonna do. || Is the box supposed to go in with the recycling? That‚Äôs an issue with a packer truck, it would crush the box and the items would get stuck in it and make a recycling turducken, then the entire thing is just contamination. This is why you‚Äôre supposed to break down your boxes in the first place. || Certain places require that you separate recyclables, so this only would work in areas where everything can be dumped into the same place. || Sorry what happens to the items next? Where do you recycle them? Wouldn't it still go to the recycling bin outside the house? I really don't understand what purpose it serves here. || Most people who care about recycling already have recycling bins. Likewise those people already know you can use a box as a box. You could only ever say ""put cardboard in this"" because different municipalities have vastly different recycling schemes. The better thing to focus on though would be to reduce the need for the cardboard boxes in the first place and looking at reusable solutions. || It would‚Äôve been a better idea if the same chewy or Walmart took that box back and used it again.",116,ZeroWaste,2025-04-23 22:56:28,shipping box recycling bin concept idea looking feedback,hey everyone idea love feedback especially logistics packaging sustainability folks care reducing waste major retailers printed simple universally understandable instructions boxes help customers turn recycling bins idea instead tossing shipping box needing separate bin follow visual steps convert box recycling container box includes icons recyclable plastic paper metal glass educational safety disclaimer scissors kids designed language agnostic works globally attached images mock instructional box could look like boxes look like walmart chewy examples recycled chewy box already reused makeshift bin kind showing people already unofficially curious would idea useful home suggestions improve worth pitching companies manufacturers anyone supply chain packaging world want collaborate taking open feedback collaboration even sharing help grow,appreciate effort seems like instructions use box box perhaps adding cutting folding instructions creative ways use something folks normally think example kid toy animal book phone stand something really get instructions cut guessing cut flaps looks like instructions closed box cut open box fold flaps easier process feel like people interested sort thing kind maybe providing idea box makes great recycle bin list ideas also really wary anything company sends tries tell recycle recycling local facility accepts regardless theoretically could recycled general going honest eveyone knows use box storage container every time get something shipped box supposed new recycling bin silly need one audience area recycling program picks cardboard folded cut size even pick box paper bag neatly filled recyclables think quite generous bin necessary know recycling effective wish move needle participation processing community chatgpt slop sorry cutting fold flaps want way quite understand purpose people already city issued recycle bins city accept anything official bin would end taken regular trash also require boxes broken put bin like take way improve anything hey everyone thank much responses read every single comment whether supported idea pushed back really appreciate honesty address things front yes used ai help mock get idea head designer wanted something visual explain concept clearly trying make look futuristic gimmicky wanted quick way show thinking get using box box groundbreaking lot people already aiming shift mindset ship millions boxes every day get tossed right away even though still life left little intention boxes could repurposed something useful even fun imagine companies like chewy walmart amazon treated boxes packaging could add printed folds icons show turn box cat fort recycling bin toy desk organizer returns box cost much could become new standard encourages people reuse instead toss know useful everyone especially places recycling already well established rules super specific people apartments places without proper bins folks like idea creative reuse think could actually help want take evolve idea something real packaging logistics sustainability enjoy creative projects love connect would make idea actually useful live better yet else could box become let build something better together give chance picked local recycling trucks picky accept things global work individual waste collection services make sure recognize even need scissors use cardboard box grocery shipments recycles every week fold flaps inward already cardboard box broken boxes separate rest recycling fills whole bin think help much cause people recycle either chronically ill disable live area pay recycle items drive place drop recycling pay gonna box supposed go recycling issue packer truck would crush box items would get stuck make recycling turducken entire thing contamination supposed break boxes first place certain places require separate recyclables would work areas everything dumped place sorry happens items next recycle still go recycling bin outside house really understand purpose serves people care recycling already recycling bins likewise people already know use box box could ever say put cardboard different municipalities vastly different recycling schemes better thing focus though would reduce need cardboard boxes first place looking reusable solutions would better idea chewy walmart took box back used
Zero co closing down what are my alternatives,"As the title states, Zeroco.com.au is closing down. What are my alternatives in Australia? 

I am not looking to make my own cleaning and beauty products, so looking for alternatives to reduce my waste. 

Thanks ","[deleted] || I gave up on them after they admitted they had known for over a year their old return system was bullshit and making more plastic waste, but kept touting it as zero waste all over the internet. Completely dishonest and turned a lot of people off the product for good. || Hiya, I've tried so many so i feel like i can give a pretty good summary. Shame about ZeroCo but great there are alternatives. 

TLDR: SKIPPER is my recommendation. Great range, fair prices, good products, low waste, nice customer service. 

Skipper are super innovative, low-waste products which actually work. My kids love dissolving the hand wash and they even help me with cleaning now. Recently, they launched the only dishwasher tablet made in Australia, without the dissovable plastic wrappers. Their hand wash, face wash, body wash and spray cleaner are all just-add-water tablets in compostable wrappers. Really beautiful products and the company seems to really care about environmental impact. Highly recommend. 

Lucent Globe - all products from China. I only bought the dish sheets and they were terrible. Didn't clean and company did not honor my request for a refund. 

Koh - the products are 99% water, and not as effective as they say. 

ForAll - it's one product which does an okay job on things but it doesn't d a great job on anything. 

Dirt Laundry - great products but same pouch return model as zeroco. They only do laundry, and i prefer to get all my needs from one company. || When I noticed all of ZeroCo‚Äôs products on massive sale a few months ago I switched to Skipper. It‚Äôs a refill based system the same as ZeroCo. They‚Äôre tablet based so the offset of their products is even less than ZeroCo. They have a similar product range to ZeroCo too, home cleaning, bathroom products, washing etc. So far I am very impressed.¬† || No recommendations, just wanted to share how deeply disappointed I am. Guess it was kinda clear before they made the announcement. Socials were quiet and the free forever bottles and very long 50% sale... || I didn‚Äôt use ZeroCo - but can recommend Dirt for laundry. || It may not be possible for everyone, but have a look around and see if there are any bulk food stores in your area that offer kitchen and bathroom products. We have one locally that refills kitchen detergent, shampoo and laundry liquid. We‚Äôve been using the same dishwashing container for 8 years, and no pouches. || Skipper is another place. There hand wash is great. I was so disappointed to read the email today though. I really love Zero‚Äôs wash  booster || I only found out about this when I received the text message advising my subscription has been cancelled.

I'm really sad to hear/see this, I love the re-usable roll-on deoderant and their deoderant. Really rare to find a refillable natural deoderant like that which actually works.

I'm distraught. I have no idea what I'm going to do.

I have a lot of zero co stuff leftover as I bulk-bought like a years supply. || JAWS - just add water system || Love to know why they closed. These seems to be a slow turn away from plastic reuse and zero waste. A lot of bulk food stores around me are closing their doors, and am wondering if zero co‚Äôs closing is part of that process or whether it was something g internally that caused the closure. || Woolies has Koh dishwashing detergent and universal cleaner at 50% off this week. 

Also laundry detergent, dishwasher tablets, other cleaning products at https://koh.com.

But yes, also looking for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand wash, etc, alternatives. || I've been loving ASUVI's hand wash, and apparently, they're doing a body wash. It's a bit different in that you have to add water, but I love the lather.

I just dilute a few drops into the spray bottle and fill with water, I bought 1 bottle in their Black Friday sale and it's still more than half full 5 months later. || I'm super interested in haircare options.

How do I be low waste when testing makeup?,"I want to start getting into makeup officially, but I don't know how to do so while being low or zero waste. (I'm also new to this low waste thing.) I have a few makeup products already from experimenting, but none of them quite work for me and give me dysphoria, but it makes me sad seeing them all in a discarded pile. Do I use them up despite them not looking good on me? I wouldn't feel right giving them to a friend since they've already been on my skin.","Go to a Sephora's or Ulta and have them test products on you. They can help you figure out what you want, what will look good on you, etc. They will try to get you to buy it there and then, but I recommend just taking pictures of what they used (shade/brand/etc) and then wearing it for the rest of the day to see how it looks after several hours. Then you can go back if you have issues and see what they recommend -- it may be a primer, or simply a different product. || I rehome bath and beauty products through my local Buy Nothing group. I understand the hygiene aspect of sharing makeup products, but I make it clear that they have been used and give individuals in my community the autonomy to decide if they‚Äôd like them. You never know what they might use them for ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è || I think inherently, makeup will never be a low-waste type of product. But I think that's OK if it's something that truly brings you joy, and you try not to over-consume (which is difficult given the intense marketing around makeup; there's always new releases, new products, new colors, new formulas, etc.) There's always a few brands of makeup with more sustainable packaging, so if you find a product you truly love in that packaging, that's a win-win.  

I think the best course of action with regards to makeup, is to try to get samples of products before committing to full size versions, and once you find your favorites, to stop looking at other products until you run out of an item. Makeup packaging is really hard to recycle, but you can see if places like Sephora near you have an empties recycling box -- the only downside I see of those is that it's only really able to take containers that are actually clean (so think jars of skincare). For products like tubes of concealer, lip gloss, mascara, etc., they seem impossible to actually get fully clean. || 99% of the makeup industry is terrible when it comes to waste. The packaging is excessive and all of it is single-use plastic. The premium prices of makeup go mostly to the fancy bottles and cases, and the marketing. 

So one approach is to start by looking for sites that promote good makeup with low-impact packaging. Etsy might be a good place to start. Once you've identified responsible manufacturers, look for sampler packages. || If you can find new uses for a product, try that for some! 

I am using a matte brown eyeshadow as contour. I am also using a brow gel I disliked for my flyaway hairs on my head. Also am using a sparkly eyeshadow as highlight sometimes. 

I mix colours of foundation to find the shade/consistency I like too. It‚Äôs never perfect but I do enjoy using up all my stuff if I can! || Some of your friends may not mind if you used it already. I know I wouldn‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôve shared lipgloss with a friend before. I think the only thing I wouldn‚Äôt share is mascara. || If you insist on using things you don't like, I would suggest hanging around r/panporn for inspiration for finishing makeup || Makeup products that don't quite work for you are great for cosplay.  Cosplay isn't designed to enhance natural features and follows different trends. If you go to any sort of con and wanna dress up, it might be a great opportunity to use it. || No don‚Äôt use them if you don‚Äôt like them. Never force yourself to finish something you hate. Depending on product they can have a layer scape off or sanitized. So I give them to friends/ family or if you have kids using them for Halloween make up. Even if you toss them it better then ruining your mental health over wearing them. Remember health is first. 

I would just chuck this down to learning experience and now you know some colors/ formulas that don‚Äôt work for you so you know what to avoid in the future. 

What I do in future when possible 

Look at video reviews at products from people with same skin type as you and skin color as you so you get clearly picture if you think your like it or not (sometimes still you might hate something you thought you like even using this method) 

Switch products in store when possible (just use arm for switching never use your lips or eyes) 

Make list of stuff your most excited to try and stick to list when shopping 

Buy a couple products so you have enough to change up look based on mood but don‚Äôt own like 30 of each make up product at a time cause by time they expire and no longer good on skin your still have ton of product left. So that why I suggest a few products of each make up type there is so you can mix and match and still use it all up before expires 

Most importantly have fun along the way and enjoy learning all the fun techniques there are. || If you're in the UK, you can take make up packaging for recycling at most Boots shops (and I think Superdrug?).

Is there any mock meats that taste like actual meat,I‚Äôm a teenager and want to stop eating meat when I become financially independent. Is there anything that actually tastes like meat? I love the flavor of beef particularly and constantly have cravings for fish and red meat. I have watched non vegans / vegetarians try different recipes and say nothing actually tastes like meat. ,"I‚Äôd say the impossible burger is scarily close. || Juicy Marbles tastes too much like a steak for me so  that is a good one to try. || Beyond sausages I think are very similar. || Meh.

They are crazy good at making mock meats like seitan duck and soy chicken. || - The mycelium steaks like meati are very very close.

- Impossible burgers are there for me. Meatloaf made from it is indistinguishable.

- Beyond breakfast patties and regular sized sausages could fool anybody.

- light life hotdogs are indistinguishable from pink slime hot dogs.

- impossible hot dogs are very very close to beef hot dogs. 

- Prime Roots brand koji based salami, pepperoni, turkey slices, ham, and Black Forest ham can fool anybody. Their pepperoni is incredible on pizza and actually ‚Äúsweats‚Äù fat and crisps up in the over instead of drying up.

- Asian markets carry very realistic shrimp and other sea life mocks. || In my opinion, vegan chicken is a lot more similar to chicken. Then vegan beef is too beef!

Meat tastes like meat, vegetables taste like vegetables... you are much, much better off trying to broaden your palate to enjoy more whole food flavors.

For me, when I transitioned to vegan I didn't really eat meat or cheese substitutes for quite a long time, and just enjoyed actual foods that are vegan -- learn to prepare beans & rice, lentils, tofu, etc in ways you enjoy.   After a while reintroduce vegan meat & cheese alternatives as an occasional treat or variation.  It is really not sustainable or realistic to imagine you can go vegan just by replacing your current omnivore diet one-to-one with veg substitutes.  

Humans are very, very adaptable.  That is our thing.  What you like is what you are used to.  Get more skilled at cooking, and ""what you like"" will shift dramatically to ""what you routinely feed yourself"".

Does anyone else feel like veganism peaked years ago? I've been vegan since 99 but it just feels like the momentum has shifted,"Yves is going under, beyond is struggling, no more beyond options at del taco or Carl's Jr. I know that is all plant-based capitalism, but fewer people seem to be going vegan overall. Just egg is always like 12.99 at whole foods and $0.99 at grocery outlet. Produce is more expensive, the war on carbs and sugar...no one truly seems to care about animal agriculture anymore and looks the other way 

It feels like a huge step down from 2015 when everyone seemed to be beginning to realize how fucked up shit is","I've noticed. It's because the world has gotten worse and worse for humans, so for many people animal rights are pushed further down the priority list in terms of importance. || I‚Äôve only been vegan for about a year or so - so I actually converted relatively recently.

Trust me - there are still new vegans coming into the movement. || Yeah, I the part of it is response to shifts in media, influencers and politics. Trump and RFK, Jr. and their war on science isn't helping. For every Dr. Michael Gregor there are 200 ""influencers"" talking about their butter diet. Capitalism (& ""democracy"") are inherently bad metrics of morals ...¬†
That said, I'd rather be a 1980s vegan buying TVP, nooch and soy milk and swapping index card recipes at the back of a natural foods store, than be a thoughtless, mindless drone that a morally follows the crowd. Stay strong, 80s vegan strong. || Veganism never peaked, plant based options might have || I feel a lot of people here are coping rather than critically addressing the question/situation. I think it‚Äôs highly situational per society/country. 
I‚Äôm in northern europe and I would agree with you that veganism as a ‚Äútrend‚Äù from 5-10 years ago is on a downtrend. 

Not seeing as many experimental options or interesting products, more safe and economical plant-based options (is probably also due to world economic situation).
Multiple fully vegan restaurants have recently closed and some have starting serving meat suddenly to appease demand & avoid bankruptcy.

In my view reductionism is on the rise and a lot more people at least are aware here of the benefits of plant-based food (I think this is crucial, compared to being aware of ethical or environmental disasters and ‚Äúnegatives‚Äù, but rather focused on health in a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù way). 

So a lot more people are ordering the vegan options at restaurants, which can be seen as progress, would have to check numbers on animals saved etc. but I think less people enter the movement fully on the vegan side, and less so because ethical reasons. I do believe that health is a great way to overtime convert from omnivore to vegan based on logic rather than dealing the guilt (I did the same). But maybe somehow people are not making full step over to veganism anymore as much as before‚Ä¶ || I‚Äôve been vegan since 94. I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs peaked or not. I wish it was going up but I‚Äôm not changing. I‚Äôll be vegan till I die. || People are more empowered about just blatantly doing the wrong thing. I mean, you have some conservatives running around villainizing *empathy*. In that context, it's pretty hard to have a dialogue about the topic.

I am not optimistic on the general public coming around any time soon, but something does give me hope is how unsustainable many animal products are. The prices will need to come down or no one will be able to afford them. || I think you are right - there was quite a surge of enthusiasm back in the twenty-teens but it faded after Covid. The animal ag sector hit back hard, some pretty weird cultural stuff happened as a result of the whole pandemic thing and now we get people wanting to eat carnivore diets and get back to ""nature"" by buying and supporting ""regenerative agriculture"" and so on. 

Part of it I think is that people were being sold the story that they could save the world and their health by going vegan, but they didn't really care about the animals part. It was self-interest, about what they could do to help themselves and their family. But they never really wanted to abandon eating meat and dairy, hence the interest in plant-based alternatives. Then along came the animal ag pushback and the influencer war on veganism, and suddenly everyone was convinced that the REAL problems are seed oils, monoculture crops to feed vegans, ultra-processed fake foods and environmental harm from expanding crop production. No matter that no-one is really buying locally from regenerative farms that are sequestering carbon and making happy cows. Nope, it's just excuses to legitimise not having to change after all.

On the positive side, there's now a rebound from the whole vegan activism side of things and I think we are seeing more positive and encouraging advocacy out there, but whether it can have any effect I don't know. Time will tell I guess. The biggest challenge is that I don't think most people can be convinced to give up eating animals... || There was a plant-based dietary fad a few years ago, and that has peaked. Unfortunately, the carnivore diet has replaced it for some as the current fad.

However, although the dietary fadders may have dropped it, the majority of those who adopted veganism as an ethical framework are still around.

It's easy to become disheartened, but remember that mass adoption of anything is seldom linear. || I've only been vegan for 1 year and 8 months. In Texas options are so limited outside of major cities. But I can tell you from travels to New Zealand and Iceland in the last 2 years, I was impressed at how many restaurants offered vegan options, or how many cities had a good amount of totally vegan restaurants. That being said, in the last year I've seen the amount of impossible/beyond/Data/Morningstar products disappearing at the grocery store. || Veganism as a fad and trend may have peaked, but that fad, even for people that valued and followed veganism, was only a seed for a world where life is respected and allowed to flourish. 

That's inevitable and isn't based in ""Veganism"" or ""Harm Reduction"", it's just the inevitable conclusion of moral and ethical thought. || I think it's better to look at it like a peak of one wave in a set of many, rather than a singular mountain.

Much like ripples, as the surface tension is bouncing from something so heavy in the water.

There is major movement. || MAGA happened and that's one of the millions of problems that comes with it. || Yes and all my favorite influencers are no longer vegan . Only a few .¬† || It's all a cycle. It will gain hype again in 10 years and even more as the economy worsens. || Feel like it peaked around 2017/2018 but that‚Äôs also when I was newly vegan & the heaviest in activism. Not really doing activism anymore nor in any vegan scenes so it inevitably feels like there‚Äôs less momentum to me as well. But I should get back to activism || No, the entire economy is tanking. It's not about veganism. || 2015/2016. The timeline went to shit after that gorilla was murdered. || Momentum has changed since the pandemic, for sure. People are less compassionate to others when they feel like the system is being cruel to them. || Naw, a vegan world will happen slowly but surely.

Career paths for vegans,"Real change for animals won‚Äôt come from diet choices alone. If we want to shift society in a lasting way, we need people who care about animals working in the places where decisions get made. This means stepping into things like marketing, food science, policy, finance, investing, and beyond. One vegan in any of these roles will not dismantle animal agriculture overnight, but each can create ripples that expand outward.

Take marketing. A vegan marketer won‚Äôt convince the world to stop eating meat with a single campaign, but they can give plant-based products a fighting chance in a crowded market. The truth is, most people don‚Äôt buy food because of animal welfare. They buy what is tasty, affordable, (sometimes) healthy, and convenient. That means plant-based brands can‚Äôt just be ‚Äúas good‚Äù as animal products, they have to be better on those fronts if we want to outperform them. A skilled marketer can reframe plant-based eating not as a sacrifice, but as an upgrade. I plan to make a further post concerning how to do this. 

Food science works the same way. A single scientist won‚Äôt reinvent the grocery store, but they can push small improvements that lower barriers. A plant-based cheese that melts better, a burger that tastes more like beef, or even better than beef, a milk that‚Äôs fortified to be healthier. All of these make it easier for people to switch without feeling like they‚Äôre giving anything up. Since taste, price, and convenience drive most choices, these small gains matter.

Policy is harder, but it‚Äôs one of the most powerful tools we have. A vegan in policy won‚Äôt stop subsidies to factory farming overnight, but they can help secure funding for alternatives. That might mean research in cellular agriculture or precision fermentation, or plant breeding programs for high-protein crops. They could advocate for clearer labeling that makes plant-based products more attractive and push for more plant-based meals in school lunch programs. These steps won‚Äôt transform the food system in a year, but they lay the groundwork. One modest program creates precedent for another, and progress builds.

Finance is another overlooked lever. A vegan financial advisor can guide clients toward portfolios that exclude companies tied to factory farming, or toward sustainable funds that include plant-based innovators. Even small shifts in capital matter, because investment fuels growth. If more financial professionals take plant-based businesses seriously, they gain credibility. Venture capitalists and private equity investors can go even further, helping plant-based companies scale, cut costs, and compete on price. Even accountants and auditors have a role by pushing companies to recognize risks tied to climate, ethics, and regulation. Pressures that animal agriculture is increasingly exposed to.

And then there‚Äôs personal finance. You can start by learning basic financial literacy and using tax advantaged accounts like retirement accounts. IRAs or 401(k)s (traditional or roth, depends on your goals and what your company offers) Anyone can steadily build wealth over decades. The compounding is slow at first, but over decades it can add up to hundreds of thousands, even millions. That wealth can one day fund sanctuaries, fuel nonprofits, or help launch plant-based startups. The key is patience. Withdrawing early hinders compounding growth, which is the biggest money multiplier.

If you want a deeper dive into how to enter these fields, what to aim for once you‚Äôre there, and the strategies with the highest impact, let me know.

"Seeking personalized advice, want to be vegan","Hello people! I would like to be vegan, and I'm looking for personalized advice.

I am a pescetarian for 12 years. My decision was solely for animals. It's why I've maintained that diet. I understand it's not enough. I have always admired vegans, and I believe that it's the right moral choice. For the past 10 years or so I have thought about on repeat about how I should be vegan, and would be, if I were a better person.

Please see my comment for further details about things I'm hoping to get advice regarding! Thank you!! ","You're not in a super easy situation but you can definitely do it. My ideas for you are:  
\-Start by being vegan at home and pescetarian when you go out if there are no vegan options at the restaurant

\-Research vegan friendly options in your area, a lot of places have them now or at least vegetarian and you can ask for things to be taken off to make them vegan

\-Liking beans is a great start, you have to experiment with different ingredients (vegetables, legumes etc) to find out what you like. Try new recipes but also build a handful of go-to recipes for every day (I eat mostly the same few meals throughout the month). Try veganizing dishes you already eat.  
\- I am vegan and also don't like fruit, you definitely don't need to like fruit to be vegan!   
\-I use pintrest to find new recipes, look for ""easy"" ""10 minute"" and ""vegan"" etc   
\-If you are vegan mainly for the animals and don't have an issue with junk food there is loads of easy processed vegan foods now (vegan meat-like burgers, cheeses, mayo, etc) so I don't want to promote unhealthy eating but you can be vegan and find easy ready meals.   
\-Not sure what the best approach is for your husband, it really depends on what he is like. If he sees that going vegan really makes you happy then I hope he will support it. Remember you can start at 50% vegan and work your way up, it doesn't have to be 100% overnight.   
\-If your man likes animals at all, watch some vegan documentaries with him, they will help to get him to see your side and hopefully also care himself 

I hope this is helpful || Hi there! I‚Äôve been vegan for almost a decade now but before that, I was also a long time pescatarian! Everyone starts somewhere and everyone‚Äôs journey to veganism is unique to them and their needs. What matters most is that you‚Äôre honoring what aligns with your moral standards üå±üíö

I liked the suggestion from another commenter saying to try being vegan at home while learning to navigate restaurants and social gatherings as a vegan. There‚Äôs a fair amount of trial and error to be discovered when it comes to asking the right questions to staff/chefs regarding ingredients in their dishes. For example, I would ask my favorite Chinese takeout place if they used fish sauce, they said no but I would still get an upset stomach after eating my food. Eventually I learned to ask if they used oyster sauce. They confirmed that they did- but now I am able to order my food without upsetting my stomach (or my head)! It‚Äôs unfortunate that our bodies end up bearing the burden of other‚Äôs ignorance / miscommunication / translation differences but after that first year or so, it happens very rarely as you learn to anticipate some of these things. 

Idk if you would find this helpful but I also battled an eating disorder. And to be honest, it‚Äôs not something that necessarily went ‚Äúaway‚Äù but something I‚Äôve learned to sorta soft parent in order to prioritize fueling my body so that it‚Äôs energized and nurtured. I really resonate with your saying that if eating requires a lot of effort, you won‚Äôt eat at all or will only eat something that doesn‚Äôt provide enough fuel. Cuz same. I almost exclusively lived off of mac & peas for two years bc it was easy and all I had the energy to cook. It took me a while, but I figured out an effective meal prepping plan that helps ensure that I can just grab and reheat food when I get hungry so I don‚Äôt end up ignoring those hunger cues and dissociating from my body. (I would be more than happy to share what that planning and prepping looks like if you want!)

Addressing your selective eating, I‚Äôve found the wisdom from occupational therapists to be quite helpful in this regard! For context, I hated most vegetables due to the associations I developed with them when I was younger. Veggies, to me, meant shame and guilt. So, once I had the opportunity to just not eat them now that they weren‚Äôt being forced down my throat, I didn‚Äôt! But my nutrition suffered from that. Sometimes the emotional barriers to foods are what‚Äôs causing the aversion so I would recommend, if you‚Äôre comfortable, experimenting with the foods you don‚Äôt currently prefer. A specific example I learned in an OT seminar- a student was refusing to eat spaghetti and red sauce. They would cry and panic when it was served. Turns out, when they were super young, they had almost choked on spaghetti and their brain correlated spaghetti to not being safe! The approach to dismantling that distress and providing opportunities to develop positive associations with spaghetti meant getting creative with different pasta shapes, deconstructing the sauce, having the student be involved with the cooking process, etc etc until eventually they no longer reacted and could eat pasta with red sauce unperturbed. 
Obviously, take from that as you will- I‚Äôm not a doctor nor a nutritionist but as a fellow disordered eater, my associations with food are often (to put it simply) that it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Being vegan sorta knocked down a wall of guilt I would have when eating knowing that no creature was harmed for the sake of my food choices. I have a visceral memory of a summer cookout where my family was eating steak. I remember looking down at my plate and crying because I knew a cow had died for me to eat and I didn‚Äôt want to eat that poor animal. And then I cried that their life had been wasted on me since I wasn‚Äôt even going to enjoy the meal which made me feel horrible inside. I didn‚Äôt even know it was an option to not eat meat and make my own food choices until much later. But, my shame and guilt over food diminished greatly once my plate reflected what I valued. 

All that to say, being vegan is possible! It‚Äôll take time and a lot of repetitive conversations with people, but hopefully you‚Äôll find it worthwhile. It sucks that your husband doesn‚Äôt appear to be super supportive (right now) but I‚Äôve found that documentaries such as The Game Changers or Dominion, or even the movie Okja can do the talking for you when it comes to expressing why it‚Äôs important to reevaluate what‚Äôs going on your plate.   

Wishing you the best ü´∂üèªüå± || My husband eats meat. My husband gets frustrated when I bring up that I want to be vegan. He mentions how with me being a picky eater and a pescetarian it's already hard when it comes to finding restaurants and dishes we both like. I love my husband. He unfortunately will likely never be vegan. I'm just mentioning because it feels like a factor I have to think about if I am to become vegan.

I want to mention a few other things because I think they're important in figuring out how I can make some sort of sustainable transition and lifestyle thereafter. I'm an incredibly picky eater. I suffered from neglect as a child and literally did not eat ANY fruits or vegetables besides bananas until my late teens. I did not eat nuts. I did not eat legumes. I did not have a nutritious or diverse diet.

As an adult I slowly began to introduce myself to additional foods, but I am still incredibly picky. I'm not sure if it's a consequence of my upbringing, or some sort of sensory sensitivity, or both. Learning to eat different kinds of foods has been difficult. I've learned I like nuts and beans. I like some veggies cooked. I dislike most raw veggies except for carrots, romaine, and spinach. I don't really eat the majority of fruits, the juicy texture and tartness are unappealing to me. My husband tells people I'm an unhealthy pescetarian because most of my diet is carbs.

One last thing, I have a history of disordered eating and needed treatment at an eating disorder clinic. It's part of what made me cautious about pursuing a vegan diet in the past. I've done well for 10 years now. It's not a concern for me right now, but I think in general I'm just a weirdo when it comes to food. I don't really cook, and if I have to put in a lot of effort to prepare food, I will just prefer to eat junk or not eat. Anyway, thanks for your help!

Edit: I see I was downvoted. That's not really helpful to me. I'm a person with a genuine and strong interest in being vegan. If I did something wrong, it would be helpful to know what. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è || You might consider [www.challenge22.com](http://www.challenge22.com), which is a 30-day ""try vegan"" challenge that offers a wealth of info on plant-based diets and veganism and realtime access to mentors and dieticians. I've had some experience with them and can say it's a very positive environment and the mentors are super helpful. || wrt your husband, i would hope that if he realizes it's important to you, he will make adjustments, even if he does not go vegan himself. my parents are have done that. i recognize they will probably never stop eating meat, and that is disheartening. but they cooked vegan food for me when i was younger and decided i wanted to go vegan, they eat with me at vegan restaurants without any shitty quips about it, they buy me vegan desserts for my birthday or new snacks at the store they think i might like, they enjoy the food i cook. sometimes that's the best compromise you can get with loved ones. that said, I would not allow yourself to be disrespected if he continuously bemoans how difficult you're being. maybe set up some boundaries from the beginning, like i understand that this makes things mkre complicated and difficult with eating out, but i'm sticking with my decision, and i would hope you will support me in this. idk i'm no therapist but you get the idea.

with the diet, i'm not sure i'm the best person to help as i eat a ton of fruits and veggies lol. but (and please don't take this the wrong way lol), have you considered looking at recipes for young kids where they sneak veggies in? stuff like zucchini in the brownies, blending up vegetables in the soup broth, stuff like that? it could help round out your diet and get more veggies in. you may also want to look at more ""processed"" fruit options where it's always the same, like apple sauce, fruit leather, and smoothies. plus i think all of these options might help you realize which fruit/veggies you like enough to try in other ways! || Stop buying fish

(I also deal with ED, so it‚Äôs been a layered process.)

We‚Äôre in this together! I went fully vegan just over a month ago. Have you been trying tofu much? I‚Äôve been experimenting with new recipes, and honestly, it‚Äôs been a total game changer. I had no idea how versatile it was, and now I‚Äôm its biggest fan. I‚Äôm pretty picky too, and ADHD sensory issues can hit me out of nowhere, even with foods I normally like ‚Äî but tofu has been surprisingly adaptable. 

I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your husband‚Äôs closed-off reaction. My boyfriend isn‚Äôt vegan either, so he still eats animals when I‚Äôm not around. But I‚Äôve found that making yummy meals, and encouraging him to learn and also cook plant-based for me, helps a lot. I really believe he can grow into this lifestyle. But, just like it took me over a decade it can take him that long too. If your husband hasn‚Äôt spent much time thinking about it, he might just need the same space and time we gave ourselves. If you bring him along while you learn new foods, he may find himself enjoying the process too. Once you get comfortable with this new cooking world, you‚Äôll both be able to enjoy the meals that come from it. It just takes time.

My biggest suggestion is to really dive into learning how to cook good home filling meals- not salads and sammy‚Äôs all the time. This will make it easy for him to step into this world.

I had amazing support from vegan friends in college (middle of my journey) it‚Äôs easier when u have dedicated vegans cooking good food and picking good restaurants. You can be his vegan light and show him what we can do with plants just like my college friends did for me ü•∞

My best advice is research everything! Your favorite meals, where you can eat, snacks, etc, and always be prepared: with a little extra planning, you will always be in a good position :-) || Just start with not buying anymore sea animal bodies. Buy vegan foods only, the rest should follow. That‚Äôs basically it. || People might hate me for saying this but truthfully you should leave your husband if you are genuinely committed to being Vegan. Especially citing compassion for animals as your main drive. If he genuinely won't change then you're just around dead flesh and skin and other awful bastardised things that belonged to animals that were murdered for them.

What does veganism say about extensive farms?,"I've been researching veganism for a while now and would like to know what vegans think about extensive farms. 

I know, I know, there are a lot of farms that are painted as extensive but are simply a little less bad than the intensive ones; but I'm referring to the idyllic ones, the ones with the farmer and his happy chickens... 

I think we can't continue consuming animal derivatives as we do, but I also think we should promote farms where the animals are happy even though there are several products, such as beef, that could not be produced at all (for reasons that any vegan who has read Peter Singer's Animal Liberation could understand).

So my point is that we should consume only the amount of animals that can be raised with a good and happy life. And that amount is very little

But I'm really eager to see what you think guys 
( Sorry if I have mistakes, I don't defend myself very well at english )","No. Animals are not here for you to use no matter how ""nicely"" you think they're being treated. Their bodies, skins, eggs, milk, hair, labor, all belong to them, not you. || sure, lets throw humans in along with them, as long as they're all happy right? || Imagine a guy date rapes a woman after taking her out for dinner, does the quality of the meal he treated her to make the rape any less bad? || Veganism says stop treating animals as commodities. Pretty clear to me.

I‚Äôm not going to promote ‚Äúless bad racism‚Äù. I‚Äôm not going to promote ‚Äúless evil animal agriculture‚Äù. || I mean for people who refuse to give up meat, I might encourage them to at least try to be mindful of where these animals are raised and in what conditions.

However, even the slaughterhouse itself is a traumatizing experience for animals. Both chickens raised for meat and chicken raised for eggs have harm bred into their DNA, similar to pugs due to selective breeding where we‚Äôve treated animals more like products than living beings.

When it comes to our personal actions, veganism is a better, kinder route for animals compared to us buying from farms that hypothetically give animals a better life than other farms (which is also hard for consumers to figure out in practice‚Äî as companies are generally deceptive about the living conditions of the animals).

If we know better, it‚Äôs not better for us to buy from ‚Äúkind‚Äù animal farms and slaughterhouses. Plenty of plant-based eaters help increase demand for food that doesn‚Äôt require raising and killing animals at all-just plant based products. We don‚Äôt have to support animal farms financially at all. 

It‚Äôs not like ‚Äúbetter‚Äù farms are taking the abused animals out of bad farms and onto good ones if vegans choose not to be vegans. It just drives up the demand for more animals to be bred and eaten. || Nothing, Veganism says that exploiting animals is wrong, that is all. || As Joey Carbstrong proved, the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù ‚Äúgood‚Äù farms are just as bad as the others. 

It‚Äôs either you support animal abolition or you don‚Äôt. || Veganism says we should not view animals as a means to an end, so farming them for their bodies, milk and eggs is not moral. If you would say ""if we must farm animals, it should at least be extensive"", then vegans would simply push back on the premise (that we must farm animals). || If you want to ask a question regarding a vegan stance it's important to first understand the vegan stance. Please come back another time. Also Peter Singer is a utilitarian and not a vegan, and definitely a hypocrite || The only way I can see it being ok to eat a ‚Äòhappy‚Äô animal is if it lives it‚Äôs full life and dies of natural causes. It‚Äôs not possible to do this for obvious reasons. Supply and demand has created the mess we‚Äôre in and is also the reason this idea will never work. || I'd consider eating the eggs of wild chickens, maybe those of a pet chicken, if I was stuck in the middle of the woods with no nutritional supplements. I would NOT be okay with any setup where the animal is treated as a commodity, that is not an earnest mutually beneficial relationship.

And in the comments you reveal that you also consider consuming the animal itself okay under this  model? I mean we can talk about harsh environments and desperate situations all day, but raising an environmentally sustainable amount of chickens, that you don't truly need, just to slaughter them as a rare delicacy?!

Finally deleted chat gpt,"I‚Äôm posting this here because I do consider environmentalism to be an important part of veganism. And, a lot of comments on this sub has led to my decision. I‚Äôve been vegan for one and a half years. Everything I eat, give my furry companions to eat, wear,my toiletries, period products, cleaning products etc are vegan.  but, I convinced myself that using ai was ok for weight loss and to vent. Everytime I would use it I knew it was having a bad environmental impact but did it anyways and gaslit myself into thinking it wasn‚Äôt *that* bad. I was being selfish and putting my needs above the planet and fellow earthlings. There‚Äôs other things I wouldn‚Äôt do: like go on another cruise, or take an hour long shower, But for some reason I felt it was necessary to talk to chat gpt everyday when people have lost weight for years before it. I‚Äôm almost 24 (been vegan since the age of 22) and I‚Äôve already learned so much from this journey and community. Thank you all! ","Veganism, simply put, is just about avoiding anything that directly exploits non-human animals for human gain. Whatever else you lump onto it may be intersectional, but it‚Äôs not veganism. || If you don't want to use ChatGPT fair enough, but it isn't a vegan issue. || Videos uses way more energy than text, so If text-based AI is so concerning, I must say that in general you should drop video-based social media. Images uses a lot too, but not as much as a video. || 300 queries use less water than an hour of watching television. A hamburger uses 600x that... || lol what || ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑ü©∑ || Tbh even without the environmentalism you should avoid ChatGPT, I noticed it has really dumbed people down in the last couple of years. || Totally agree! I HATE vegans who literally dont understand that if the environment is gone so are we AND the animals?!? What is the point of veganism if you arent on the side of ALL the living creatures of rhe world, and their freedom. || This is completely misguided. The impact of using ChatGPT is tiny compared to things that actually matter like cutting food waste, switching energy sources, or addressing industrial farming. AI will likely have a net positive effect on the environment by helping optimize energy and supply chains. Stop stressing over the wrong things and focus where it counts.üòî || Let's be clear, using chatGPT has nothing to do with veganism. It's important not to mix those two ideas up.

Your arguments against its use are from an environmental perspective. That's admirable. I too consider myself an environmentalist. I'm more than willing to change my lifestyle to avoid things that are bad for our planet.

However, I do so based on evidence. And I've not seen any convincing evidence that user level usage of LLMs like chatGPT are particularly bad for the environment in any meaningful way. Although I'm willing to change that view if more evidence comes to light.

I think it's important that we make decisions based on evidence and facts, not just vibes and misguided feelings. 

My understanding is that the training of LLMs is energy intensive, especially for the most cutting edge models. 

However when we use them the energy usage is no different than other technologies. It's comparable to watching YouTube or Netflix, or video calling, or downloading files from the cloud. 

If you're genuinely concerned by the energy use of modern technology then by all means be consistent and cut yourself off from it all. But that is an extreme and isolating thing to do. And probably won't achieve anything other than accelerating your own misery.

We are humans that live in a society. If we reject modernity as environmentalists our ideas will be avoided. Alienating our struggle, rather than seeing its mass adoption.

AI as a technology is here to stay. It is overhyped, but it also does have genuine uses. And its important to realise that AI is going to be a big part of our society going forward.

One thing I've learnt over the last decade about being an environmentalist is to not burden yourself with all the world's problems. Do what you can, and act on what you believe to be important, but understand that you can't right every wrong or solve every problem. If you try to do so you will just burn yourself out. || I don't know why so many ai apologists in this thread. Even without the environmental impact, ai steals other people's work and dumbs you down. Good for you! I'm happy you did that || It's great that you are lowering your carbon footprint in ways that are sustainable for you, but the climate impact is way less than you think. Especially since tech companies are pushing to move towards nuclear power for blockchain and AI infrastructure. || Recently deleted it too ! || Wait I‚Äôm out of the loop. What does ChatGPT have to do with environmentalism, weight loss & veganism? || You writing this post also had environmental impact. || While environmentalism and veganism are important stances, and they are somewhat related to each other (what isn't?), they are clearly distinct. I can't see any advantage of conglomerating all battles into a single huge battle. || Stop believing anti-ai nonsense. It's pitiful and politically far-left.


Making 300 requests with Chat-GPT costs less than about 2 litres.

A hamburger costs in the high HUNDREDS.


Be vegan and use AI all day every day. || üëè üëè üëè I‚Äôve avoided AI from the beginning because it absolutely TRASHES the environment and I‚Äôd feel like a hypocrite shitting in cow farts and unnecessary land use while using chat instead of google and my own brain. GOOD FOR YOU OP! || The energy use of AI interactions is hugely exaggerated. 

100 chatbot interactions a day for a year consumed about as much energy as a single 10km journey in a car. 

https://engineeringprompts.substack.com/p/ai-energy-use

10 AI searches a day would be less than 1% of your daily energy use. 

https://www.sustainabilitybynumbers.com/p/carbon-footprint-chatgpt

It uses more energy to run a Google search, or use a credit card.

Honestly, while you're still driving a car or switching on lights or using a laptop, avoiding AI is a performative change and makes practically no difference to your energy consumption.

https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use

Keeping pets alone has a much, much higher impact because of the food production costs - even if you're not feeding them meat.

If you benefit from using AI, use it. Walk to the local shops instead of taking the car, just once, and you've wiped out the impact of AI for an entire year. || Moral panic.

How can I start being vegan?,"I am 20 year old college student commuting to school. I live with my parents and work a full time job to pay for school. I cannot support the disgusting, cruel and evil that animals are put through to satisfy the desire of a human, that I have recently been made aware of. The past few days I have been disgusted thinking about eating meat and dairy, etc. I have not been eating much lately and need to start a vegan lifestyle. I am worried first about food and once I get accustomed to my diet I plan to worry about my clothing and other aspects outside of food. My question is, how do I start? What should I buy when it comes to vegan products? How can I make sure I am getting all the nutrients I need? Should I tell everyone I am close to immediately? It seems very complicated to get a balanced diet from a vegan diet but obviously this will not stop me. I really just do not know where to start. Any resources or advice that anyone has, I do genuinely appreciate. Thank you in advance so much.","Start by subbing animal products for vegan products, stop buying leather and other non-food animal products, etc. Take B12, perhaps Vit D and Omega-3 as well. You don‚Äôt need to tell everyone you‚Äôre close to unless you feel like it. || The public library prob has a few books on vegan cooking. Think through the various ways to get your needed protein as a vegan. Stir fries are easy. One of my earliest and still favorite meals I call my mountain food ~ saut√©ed firm tofu, with a splash of tamari soy sauce added at the end with brown rice (or boiled potato) with nutritional yeast over all at serving. This is what my friend turned me on to back in the day & it‚Äôs still a favorite.  You‚Äôll find yours. Start experimenting !! || to have a really basic suggestion, i would reccomend you get fortified nutritional yeast and some other sort of protein that you regularly make an effort to include in your diet, like beans, nuts, quinoa, lentils, oats, soy milk‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs many to choose from! nutritional yeast has a lot of vitamins you‚Äôd get from animal products like red meat or fish meat. i suggest using it on pasta as if it was grated parm. it doesn‚Äôt taste the same, but is very similar (you can also mix a couple tablespoons into pasta sauce and it adds flavor but doesn‚Äôt taste dry). and a protein source like lentils or quinoa just makes sure you get some sort of protein in your diet. it‚Äôs not too complicated to go vegan once you realize so long as you rely a decent amount on whole foods, and that your diet doesn‚Äôt really need to change too much, the food you eat is going to be a lot cheaper and healthier generally which is another benefit! || It's not really complicated to get your nutrirional needs met as a vegan. The main vitamin you will almost certainly need a supplement for is B12, because it is made by bacteria in the digestive systems of herbivores. Thus you can't get it from plant based foods unless they're fortified with it (for example, plant based milks usually are). B12 takes a long time to deplete in your body though, it takes years for the body's stores to deplete completely. However, I'd still recommend getting on a supplement ASAP to cover your bases. It's also worth noting B12 deficiency is not exclusive to vegans, it can happen to anyone. But we do have to watch out for it simply because the main source of B12 for most people is meat and we don't consume that.


Other than that, you absolutely can get all of your nutritional needs met through food. I'm not saying you won't need other supplements, but again, anyone can have deficiencies and need supplements. For example I take D3 because it's something I've historically been deficient in (it's a super common deficiency in general).¬†


I believe Omega-3s are another thing to pay attention to, not because they aren't available from plant based foods, but again because most people are used to getting sufficient amounts of them from animal based foods (primarily seafood), so it may not even occur to someone to find a substitute for them when they go vegan. I know nuts/seeds and canola oil can be good plant based sources for these. I think seaweed is also a potential source?


What do you like to eat already? You can focus on veganizing your favorite foods. Nowadays almost everything has a vegan version or a recipe for a vegan version.


Some of the big protein sources for vegans are tofu, beans, seitan (wheat gluten based), tempeh (soy based), and mushrooms. Commercial meat substitutes are mostly based on soy, wheat gluten, or pea protein, depending on the brand. Meat substitutes can be good especially when transitioning to veganism, but they are more expensive than beans/tofu and some people avoid them since they are more processed (I think they're totally fine in moderation like anything else). I would suggest trying different protein sources to see what you like.¬†


AFAIK, protein is made out to be somewhat of a bigger deal than it needs to be, it's really not hard to get a sufficient protein intake. If you are really athletic or into body building you need to pay more attention, but there are plenty of vegan athletes and body builders out there (there is a sub for it, I think r/veganfitness IIRC)


Otherwise, eating a variety of foods, especially vegetables and fruits, and staying hydrated, is important.¬†


You'll probably be getting a lot more fiber on a vegan diet than you were before, and that can take some getting used to.


I'm not sure where you live, this might affect how easy it is to find certain vegan foods, and what kinds are available. You definitely can be vegan anywhere, I mean pasta and sauce, rice and beans, vegetables are available most places - but it may be harder to find, for example, meat and dairy substitutes in some places. I'm in the US and in my experience any decent-sized town will have tofu, soy/oat/almond milk, and at least a few meat subs at grocery stores. I can usually find some vegan ice cream and yogurt too. Usually there are a couple of ""vegan/vegetarian"" sections, in my experience one will be a refrigerated section usually near produce, and one will be a frozen section. These are where you'll usually find stuff like tofu, tempeh, meat subs, vegan cheese and mayo etc. Sometimes Beyond/Impossible meats will be stocked in the actual meat section. Vegan milks, yogurt, butter, Just Egg are usually stocked near their animal based counterparts. Same with ice cream/frozen desserts.


I hope this helps! || I would start by finding vegan foods you enjoy, whether that's meat and dairy alternatives or just a tofu/ seitan preparation you like. 

If you're concerned about getting the proper nutrients, try tracking your food in a tracking app like MyFitnessPal or Chronometer to see if there are any gaps. B12 is the one to watch out for; a lot of people just take a B12 supplement, so they don't have to worry about it. It's easy to get enough protein on a vegan diet, but you'll likely want to incorporate some plant based proteins like tofu, tempeh, seitan, tvp, lentils, beans, etc. 

As for telling people right away, I personally did, just because I knew I was staying vegan for life and wanted to get all of the awkward conversations out of the way ASAP, but do whatever feels right for you. 

I put together this blog on going vegan awhile ago that has a lot more detail of you're interested!

https://proteindeficientvegan.com/blog/so-youre-thinking-about-going-plant-based || One step at a time. One meal at a time. Going cold turkey can be tough (for me at least). 

It's okay if it doesn't happen right away. 

It's okay to feel discouraged. 

It may take a few tries! 

Obviously, most people will say that not eating meat means you're not getting enough protein. The best source of plant protein is legumes - beans, chickpeas, lentils, quinoa, tofu and edamame, etc You'll hear B12 a lot too. 

The truth is, you can get a nutrient-complete diet on plant power! || Just start simple. Focus on whole foods like beans, lentils, grains, fruits and veggies first. Build a few staple meals you love, then layer in balance over time. You don‚Äôt have to figure it all out at once. || You‚Äôre in the right place! I‚Äôm 23 and I‚Äôve been vegan for 2+ years and I just got my blood panel results and I‚Äôm sufficient in all categories (except I‚Äôm a little low on Vitamin D3 so I‚Äôve got a daily supplement with a higher dose, I just got the ultimate multivitamin from envitamin). Protein is rarely an issue for me. I eat tofu, seitan, tempeh, beans, and sometimes meat alternatives like beyond steak, which I highly recommend as a steak substitute! If you‚Äôre iffy about tofu and such, I‚Äôd recommend starting with the frozen meat alts, unfortunately they are not always cheap. However, once you learn to cook tofu you‚Äôll save a lot of money. You can buy a block (2-3 servings of protein) for under $3. I could go on all day about this lastly I wanna recommend checking out vegan instagram accounts because they changed my life. I‚Äôve learned recipes and techniques just from a handful of vegan accounts. Some of my favorite are @justincooksgood, @ellysplate, @itsvegansis, and for high protein/workout type meals check out @that.veganbabe. And there‚Äôs soooo many more!! || Try out meal prepping as it makes things easier, overnight oats for breakfast and rice + lentils + veggies + olive oil for lunch. I saw in your other comment that your family is asian, have you talked to your parents about it?

Get some tofu, lentils, chickpeas, beans, tempeh, seitan or even protein shakes for proteins. Get some good carbs like from oats, veggies, legumes, whole grain pasta, whole grain rice, whole grain bread. 
Better fats like from walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds. 

Ask ChatGPT for a good vegan plan for a week within your budget. 

Thanks for being vegan and speak up about the injustice the animals go through. If nobody speaks up, the animals will never have a change! 

Be careful with your friends and family. They will not understand. You will hear the weirdest shit ever and wonder how stupid humanity it. Even my sister said ""the lion tho"" and my mother's husband said it's okay to shoot him in the head right now, since he is not a hyprocite. 
But don't worry about other people's failures and animal abuse. You are on the right path! üí™ || All vegetables, beans, peas, edamame, tofu, tempeh, lentils, all nuts, all milk replacements, all meat replacements, all seeds, all fruits, rice, quinoa, buckwheat, nutritional yeast! :)


Also just check the back of products for the ingredients and learn which aren't vegan. Alot of products where I live are accidentally vegan already lol


EDIT: and make sure to take b12 supplements. I take 2 tablets of 1000micrograms a week. You can't really take too much, your body takes what it needs and pees the rest out. || You know how most people around you (and probably you too) generally eat some sort of meat and/or dairy product with every meal? Replace those with legumes. Make sure you're getting at least 3-5 servings of legumes a day. Otherwise you're not going to feel good. Make sure you're eating a variety of foods. I've found having frozen broccoli, frozen peas, and a variety of canned beans around helps a lot. Also a variety of nuts and seeds. Sounds like you're already eating plenty of fruit, but make sure you're getting grains like oats, rice, whole grain bread, etc. don't buy into the raw vegan or fruitarian nonsense, that's actually nonsense and not good for you. I also personally eat a lot of rice. In a rice cooker. Oh, and vegetable soup. Just boil vegetables in a pot and add salt and spices to taste. It's actually really good and a sustainable way to eat 

Tofu is good actually and will make your eating more enjoyable. Buy the super firm (not extra firm. Super firm) kind, cube it, throw it on a baking sheet with a little oil, some liquid soy aminos and some coconut aminos, set your oven to about 400 degrees fahrenheit for about an hour, flipping it around a couple of times in the process. It's actually really delicious, I promise.

Take a vitamin with B12 and vitamin D. Also an omega 3 algae oil supplement. You may want to take a b-complex multivitamin with vitamin D and iron -- to me, that's the simplest option, as I've also struggled with iron deficiency. Talk to your doctor and maybe get a blood test to see if you have any deficiencies. Personally, I've had good experience with creatine as well, as it helped me with brain fog. Creatine tends to be more effective with vegans.

Track what you're eating with the cronometer app for a week or two. You may notice you're consistently deficient in a couple of things, and so you can look up foods that have more of those particular nutrients and incorporate them into your diet.

If someone asks you why you're a vegan, you can cite the animals and how you don't want to violate their consent (the big one), you can cite the health benefits of a plant based diet (hotly debated even in this sub, you'll have to do your own research on that. I do like nutritionfacts.org and Dr. Michael greger for that info personally, but he is accused of cherrypicking studies.), you can cite the environmental harm that the meat industry does. Those are the big three reasons you'll hear. Another I don't hear too often is that pollutants biomagnify as they go up the food chain, so eating on lower trophic levels limits your exposure to those pollutants. I like mentioning this to nonvegans because they usually aren't prepared for it, they usually don't have preprepared defenses against it, and it can start them thinking in a different way, hopefully also getting them to consider the consequences of their actions for animals and the environment, ultimately. However, you should remember you don't have to do defend yourself and you don't owe anyone any explanation for what you do. Don't let people bring meat to your house if you're not okay with that. They wouldn't bring pork to a muslim's house, would they? It may take some time getting some people in your life to respect this.

Pack snacks in your car and with you in general. Some restaurants don't have what you want. If you're getting food with friends that aren't used to you being a vegan, you may find yourself ordering a veggie pizza without cheese, or just having fries and a beer. Advocate for yourself and encourage your friends to go some place that has better options for you. The best fast food places I've found are taco bell, subway, and burger king, in that order. Snacks in your car or at work can help. I like having larabars and maybe some crackers with me.

Good on you for taking the initiative to do less harm and be more conscious of the consequences of your actions. || I would star by making a list of foods that you already like which just happen to be vegan. Like for example you may already like overnight oats, guacamole, corn on the cob, black bean burritos, hummus, bean salad, peanut butter and jelly. Even if these are just side dishes, write them all down.

Then make a list of at least 6 dishes that you like which you think there are vegan versions for. Like for example, tacos, pizza, chili, burgers, lasagna, pad thai . Anything you can think of. If you search for easy budget friendly vegan recipes on the internet, you'll see that there really are a lot of resources out there.

Try to come up with a handful of meals made up of vegan things that you already like. For example, if you already like hummus, you could turn that into a veggie wrap where hummus is the main ingredient. Stuff like that. Then look up vegan recipes for some of your non vegan favorites and see if any recipes sound doable to you.

Once you have a list of 6 meals you'd like to make, you'll know what to shop for. Try to create meals that include grains, beans (or tofu), fruits and veggies. The greater variety of whole plant foods you eat the better your nutrition will be. This goes for non-vegans as well. Eating out may take some planning because restaurants vary so much in terms of how vegan friendly they are. There's almost always something you can eat though.

The only nutrient you really have to address is vitamin B12. Fortunately B12 supplements are inexpensive and easy to take. Get a B12 supplement and take it every day just to make sure you're covered. You may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement too, but that's not as crucial. || find carbs like bread and pasta that has raw sugar instead of white sugar
white sugar usually contains bone char || Don't buy the vegan alternatives in food. They are expensive and it's the biggest mistake new vegans make (plant milks are fine if you can't do without,but the rest are best to be avoided).

My advice,buy lentils and beans and grains (rice,wheat in all forms and etc.). It's affordable,easy to cook,you can make it in batches, and it's filling (pair each meal with vegetables for a more filling meal). Grain and protein (beans and lentils) is the basic combo.

Diet is probably going to be the biggest change, so focus on that.

I would notify the people who make you food,like your nuclear family, that you want to not consume animal products. It can be good if you are willing to cook for yourself for a while.

You are going to have cravings sooner or later,it's fine,it's your body adjusting,it doesn't mean that you are weak. Also applies to 'pitfalls' (caving to strong cravings,peer pressure,mistakes and etc.) Just keep going,a mistake doesn't mean that you failed.

Don't stress over ""invisible"" ingredients like all E's and some use of animal products along the line of production (like some beers and wines). It will come with time (and googling), and focus on the important stuff first (obvious animals products) but get used to reading labels.

It can be a very isolating experience,try to find a support system online or IRL to help you deal with that. || Just don't eat any gummy products honey milk cheese yogurt breads with butter added to them or meat of any kind also watch for vitamins some have shellfish in em there's levels to veganism like you can go all in and stop showering and live in a tree or figure out some compromises you'll stick to || *^(THIS IS NOT WRITTEN BY AI - I WROTE THIS UTILIZING MY OWN KNOWLEDGE-BASE AND PROSE.)*

To keep it simple: include 1 fat, 1 carb, 1 protein, and 1 of something vitamin- & mineral-rich.

For example: Potatoes (carb), walnuts (fat) , beans (protein), and Swiss chard (vitamin- and mineral-rich).

Then, switch up your choices. Switch out walnuts for avocado one time. Switch up your carbs like pasta, rice, or other grains. Instead of beans, go lentils or hemp seeds.

Examples of fats: **Algae oil**; Olive oil; Avocado; Peanuts; Sunflower seeds; **Coconut** milk, meat and oil; Chia

Examples of carbs: **Quinoa**; Brown rice; Parsnips; Corn or popcorn;

Examples of mineral- and vitamin-rich food: **Seaweeds and kelps**, Spinach; Cauliflower; Long beans (yellow beans, green beans, etc); Beets; Moringa; Squashes

Examples of proteins: Pumpkin seeds; Pecans; **Lentils**; Hemp seeds

\*Algae oil provides both DHA and EPA omega-3 which cannot be sourced from any other non-vegan food. Normal bodies are able to synthesize these nutrients from ALA omega-3 but not everyone can.

\*Seaweed and kelp is an excellent source nutrients including iodine.

\*Quinoa is cheap, goes far and is also high in protein and fibre.

\*Lentils are super cheap, makes a LOT of food, is easy to prepare and is high in protein and iron.

Iron is a tricky one, so be sure to include at least one food each day that is a good source of iron.",33,vegan,2025-08-24 07:42:46,start vegan,year old college student commuting school live parents

"Thailand's Plant-Based Market Reaches THB45 Billion, Aims to Be Global Kitchen","The plant-based market continues to boom in Thailand, with more and more plant-based companies popping up every year and more people eating plant-based meals.

Advice for improving my nutrition,"It's been almost two years since I went vegan and while I initially did well managing my nutrition, I feel like I've gone downhill since then, in part due to my mental health difficulties, so much to the point that I was recently thinking about quitting due to the stress food has been causing me. But the thing is, when you know something is morally the right thing, how can you just stop?

So I've decided it's time to pull myself together and optimise my diet to cause as little harm and be as healthy as possible. This includes things like trying to avoid plastic packaging, trying to only eat regional and organic food, avoiding sugar and trying to limit myself to wholegrains. But since trying to research everything to find out what is healthy, what causes the least harm and so on can be difficult, as well as finding recipes and products that fit the criteria, I would really appreciate it if you guys could share tips, recipes and knowledge on optimising my nutrition. It's not a disaster if the food is a bit low on it's caloric intake because I'd rather eat less to reduce my harm than eat more and cause unnecessary suffering.","If you're mentally a mess your diet will be shit whether you're vegan or not.


Is say get a good multivitamin/mineral and just try your best , but don't stress too much. Lots of people live on essentially burgers, fries and soda. You won't die immediately. || Whoah just start where you are

[Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/daily-dozen/)

Take a daily multivitamin supplement like others said, for extra assurance. Take a separate B12 supplement if your multivitamin doesn't have enough (50mcg per day or 2000mcg once per week) or eat fortified foods like nutritional yeast. Add a protein supplement if you have hypertrophy goals. 

I also recommend at least 5 grams of creatine per day to all vegans. It's not essential, but vegans get none from their diet (naturally found in skeletal muscle). Personally, it has been miraculous for my energy levels and mental clarity. || Honestly, I do not like cooking. But I wanted to eat plant based. I came up with a formula that, according to My Fitness Pal, works pretty good. It also follows Dr. Furman GBOMBS (greens, beans, onions, mushrooms, berries and seeds)

But basically, a half cup of whole grains. I'll precook those and freeze them in portions. A half cup of beans. A healthy handful of leafy greens, cooked mushrooms, cooked or raw onion, any other vegetables I have and want to use up, a sprinkling of hemp hearts, and a sprinkling of sliced almonds.

"Is it possible to be vegan if you don‚Äôt like Tofu, seitan and tempeh‚Ä¶?","So for context, I have been vegan for 3 months now and I FULLY believe in the cause and the lifestyle. The thought of paying someone to abuse animals makes me so uncomfortable and I never want to participate in that ever again. 

Anyways since being vegan I have realized that I don‚Äôt really like the taste of tofu seitan and tempeh. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm doing something wrong because I‚Äôve tried cooking with it and while some meals taste okay‚Ä¶ that tofu taste is just not really my thing. With tempeh and seitan it‚Äôs mostly the smell. I mean I will eat it but I‚Äôm almost forcing myself to eat these things and I don‚Äôt really enjoy it. I‚Äôm almost just racing to finish the food so I can get it over with, which isn‚Äôt satisfying or enjoyable at all. 

Because of this- I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve been skimping on the protein and there‚Äôs hardly any days I reach my suggested daily protein intake (~56g). I get most of my protein from other vegan protein sources like beans, alt meats, and TVP. Recently I‚Äôve been worried because my ankles hurt and feel weak and i am worried it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not getting enough protein. 

I love MANY vegan meals I‚Äôve prepared for myself and bought on trips out of town(not many vegan options in my area) but many of them don‚Äôt have much protein(I love veggies and mushrooms). 

Any other vegans in the same boat in that they don‚Äôt really love Tofu, seitan, and tempeh? Were you able to overcome it over time? Any advice any long term vegans have for me that maybe felt the way I do initially? 

","I rarely have tofu or tempeh and I never have Seiten.


Tofu just tastes like the seasoning to me, so I don't understand not liking the taste.¬† I think you just need to season more.¬† I eat it in stir frys when I have it.


I primarily eat lots of beans for protein. || Yeah, madras lentils forever || You could just eat edamame instead. That‚Äôs the original unprocessed form of soy. || Oh course! Protein is important, but you don‚Äôt need anywhere near as much as most people think. 

Focus on eating whole plant foods, and make sure you get enough calories. After that, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to be deficient in protein. || I'd like to say the problem could be that you are treating tofu and seitan like meat in terms of seasoning. Most people use light seasoning on meat because meat can taste good without heavy seasoning. With tofu and seitan, it's normally only good if heavily seasoned or drenched is some kind of sauce. Heavily spiced things like general tso's sauce or butter ""chicken"" sauce might help. || Shelled hemp and pumpkin seeds are full of protein and taste amazing.

I must eat at least 10 different types of nuts which are packed with protein.

I also drink protein shakes that taste pretty good but not as healthy as they contain things like sucralose. || It took me a while to get tofu right, I just wasn‚Äôt cooking it right, I think my problem was I was rushing it. Anyway, I almost gave up on it, but now it‚Äôs my favorite thing! || Do you even lentils bro || try tvp. but honestly you are probably just making it wrong if you don't like any of those in any way. Especially tofu: it has a pretty neutral taste and just tastes like whatever you put it in, which is why it can be used in basically everything from breakfast to dessert to smoothies etc. Sweet or savory, tofu doesn't care. There isn't really much of a taste to it on its own. No way you can taste tofu in an ice cream dish, it will just taste like the fruit or other sweeteners you used. || Beans, falafel, hummus, mushrooms, pumpkin seeds, and the list goes on. There is also vegan protein powder that you can blend into smoothies/shakes/bowls. || I also forgot to mention that a LARGE amount of my protein intake comes from meat alts and I know that it is unsustainable because of how unhealthy some can be. üòï || The joke is that when someone goes vegan they eat tofu with lots of sauce/seasoning, then after a while they eat it with salt and pepper and then after a while they eat it raw out of the packet.
I‚Äôve been vegan 6 years and I‚Äôve hit raw out of the packet stage, I can taste all the different flavours in it and really enjoy it.
Just remember that your pallet will evolve over time and will enjoy different things. Everything is temporary.
A bit like people who never eat veggies, when you feed them a carrot and they want to vom. || Alt meats and TVP are very high in protein per kcal (alt meats vary but are generally high. tvp is always very high. 15g of protein per just 100kcal. 200kcal of tvp is already 30g, more than half of your 56g intake. That‚Äôs around 60g of dry and 150g of wet tvp. And that‚Äôs just the tvp that you‚Äôd realistically eat in one single meal, not including all the other components of that meal). 

Beans and other legumes are moderately high in protein but insanely healthy and high in fiber and it‚Äôs good that you are eating them. I‚Äôm really surprised how you‚Äôre not able to reach 56 g. How many kcal do u eat? Are you sure that you are counting right? Frankly 56 g a day is within ‚Äúeasily reachable with moderate sources of protein alone‚Äù territory if you are eating 1700kcal-2000kcal. If you ate one can of kidney beans a day and literally ate no other moderate protein sources and all your other calories came from white rice and you only ate 1700kcal a day you‚Äôd still reach 50g of protein (and I‚Äôm sure that you don‚Äôt eat in this extreme way) . At 2000kcal of this extreme diet you‚Äôre already on 56g. 

Do you drink soy milk? Are you counting things that aren‚Äôt your main protein source? (carbs and veggies also add to your daily protein). I think that unless you are eating a low amount of daily calories you are probably miscalculating your protein intake very significantly. Either that or you are eating like a quarter of a can of beans and the rest is rice or 20 g of tvp and the rest is potato. Probably miscalculating. I don‚Äôt mean this in a gaslighty way, just an encouragement to re-look at your numbers. || If you feel like you are not getting enough protein without those foods, don't be afraid to supplement with a vegan protein powder.  Tons of different types and flavors, I'm sure you can find a few you enjoy. || I mean... tofu  is pretty much completely tasteless. It tastes like what you cook it in/marinade it in/season it with. 

Texture wise? It changes depending what you do to it.   


It is a blank slate.   
  
So I recommend trying it again lol 

But if you don't like it... buy vegan protein powder and then eat loads of beans, pulses etc. you'll be fine. || My partner hates all three and she hasnt had any issues. || You should be eating legumes 2x/day and nuts 1x/day. Don‚Äôt worry about influencer levels of protein goals. You‚Äôre not trying to be a body builder. || [deleted] || Can't comment on ankles/weakness situation. That probably needs looking into in any case.

I've never eaten tempeh or seitan, and only occasionally get tofu. Main protein sources are usually chickpeas, lentils and tvp. All of these are pretty versatile, so you can figure out your favourite ways of preparing them. If you can get lentil etc flour, even more so. || I think legumes should be the base; however, TVP and tofus can be really great to hit easily your proteins goal.


There are a lot of different tofus, some of them are already seasoned and I really think you have tofu for all tastes. You should consider trying other brands or flavor !


I am not saying you MUST eat tofu or tempeh or seitan, but it can become handy in some situations (if you want more proteins, for instance if you had a light meal at lunch or if you do a lot of exercise) and I think you can try to see if other alternatives can be good for you, so later if you want you'll be able to have it easier üòÅ",0,vegan,2025-08-22 03:34:24,possible vegan like tofu seitan tempeh,context vegan months fully believe cause lifestyle thought paying someone abuse animals makes uncomfortable never want participate ever anyways since vegan realized really like taste tofu seitan tempeh know something wrong tried cooking meals taste okay tofu taste really thing tempeh seitan mostly smell mean eat almost forcing eat things really enjoy almost racing finish food get satisfying enjoyable admit skimping protein hardly days reach suggested daily protein intake g get protein vegan protein sources like beans alt meats tvp recently worried ankles hurt feel weak worried getting enough protein love many vegan meals prepared bought trips town many vegan options area many much protein love veggies mushrooms vegans boat really love tofu seitan tempeh able overcome time advice long term vegans maybe felt way initially,rarely tofu tempeh never seiten tofu tastes like seasoning understand liking taste think need season eat stir frys primarily eat lots beans protein yeah madras lentils forever could eat edamame instead original unprocessed form soy oh course protein important need anywhere near much people think focus eating whole plant foods make sure get enough calories nearly impossible deficient protein like say problem could treating tofu seitan like meat terms seasoning people use light seasoning meat meat taste good without heavy seasoning tofu seitan normally good heavily seasoned drenched kind sauce heavily spiced things like general tso sauce butter chicken sauce might help shelled hemp pumpkin seeds full protein taste amazing must eat least different types nuts packed protein also drink protein shakes taste pretty good healthy contain things like sucralose took get tofu right cooking right think problem rushing anyway almost gave favorite thing even lentils bro try tvp honestly probably making wrong like way especially tofu pretty neutral taste tastes like whatever put used basically everything breakfast dessert smoothies etc sweet savory tofu care really much taste way taste tofu ice cream dish taste like fruit sweeteners used beans falafel hummus mushrooms pumpkin seeds list goes also vegan protein powder blend smoothies shakes bowls also forgot mention large amount protein intake comes meat alts know unsustainable unhealthy joke someone goes vegan eat tofu lots sauce seasoning eat salt pepper eat raw packet vegan years hit raw packet stage taste different flavours really enjoy remember pallet evolve time enjoy different things everything temporary bit like people never eat veggies feed carrot want vom alt meats tvp high protein per kcal alt meats vary generally high tvp always high g protein per kcal kcal tvp already g half g intake around g dry g wet tvp tvp realistically eat one single meal including components meal beans legumes moderately high protein insanely healthy high fiber good eating really surprised able reach g many kcal u eat sure counting right frankly g day within easily reachable moderate sources protein alone territory eating kcal kcal ate one kidney beans day literally ate moderate protein sources calories came white rice ate kcal day still reach g protein sure eat extreme way kcal extreme diet already g drink soy milk counting things main protein source carbs veggies also add daily protein think unless eating low amount daily calories probably miscalculating protein intake significantly either eating like quarter beans rest rice g tvp rest potato probably miscalculating mean gaslighty way encouragement look numbers feel like getting enough protein without foods afraid supplement vegan protein powder tons different types flavors sure find enjoy mean tofu pretty much completely tasteless tastes like cook marinade season texture wise changes depending blank slate recommend trying lol like buy vegan protein powder eat loads beans pulses etc fine partner hates three hasnt issues eating legumes x day nuts x day worry influencer levels protein goals trying body builder deleted comment ankles weakness situation probably needs looking case never eaten tempeh seitan occasionally get tofu main protein sources usually chickpeas lentils tvp pretty versatile figure favourite ways preparing get lentil etc flour even think legumes base however tvp tofus really great hit easily proteins goal lot different tofus already seasoned really think tofu tastes consider trying brands flavor saying must eat tofu tempeh seitan become handy situations want proteins instance light meal lunch lot exercise think try see alternatives good later want able easier
Trying to be vegan,"Hi! I am really trying to be vegan and I need some advices from those who struggled with the transition. I ve been vegetarian for one month and it was preetty okay until I got home to my parents and the food was so different compared with what I eat when I prepare it myself. I come from a country wich traditional food is related a lot with meat (wich it applies to a lot of other countries ofc but I feel here it comes in more other shapes) and I grew up with it and it‚Äôs really hard to not eat it. When it comes to milk I tried everything, oat, rice, coconut, wheat, almond - I just can‚Äôt like it. I drink my coffee with milk and I can‚Äôt like it with other kind of milk. If i make pancakes it works with almond milk. 

I want to be vegan for justice of the animals but it‚Äôs really really hard. I wish someone could give me some tips and tricks that are really helpful, maybe something that‚Äôs niche or helped you. Thank you üôè ","The more you educate yourself on the realities of the diary and meat industry, the more you will hate the idea of indulging in it. 
As for milk, you get used to the taste of oat/ soy milk over time and you will never want to go back. Especially now that you know you are not stealing milk from a mother while her baby starves. Try different brands of plant based milks and you‚Äôll find one you like || This sounds like addiction. When you continue to avoid animal products, your tastes will go along with those changes. Eating with family is a challenge for many people. Consuming animals is an issue kind of around the world. You can do this! || That's ok, forget about labels and make slow transition.
Is milk a problem? Stop eating what goes easily and leave milk for the last step.
Give yourself a time.
When it comes to family:going outs it will always be a problem. But it's not vegan case only, if you are bodybuilder, having any disorder related with diet, got any religious food restrictions or even if you want to stop drinking alcohol - all such people will face the issue of visiting or hosting family that doesn't get it at all. || There comes a point where veganism gets hard. Many times, you have to make sacrifices and compromises for stuff you previously loved / took for granted, and it can be tough letting those things go.

I think that‚Äôs the point, though, and what gives your personal journey of veganism more meaning. If it was easy, anyone with an inch of empathy for animals would do it. But it‚Äôs not easy, and that‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs a test of your mettle and your commitment to the cause.

Since you‚Äôre starting, and struggling quite a bit, I‚Äôd suggest a transition. Some people can just cold turkey it and do fine (like me), others need to take more time and that‚Äôs okay too. Just keep reminding yourself why you‚Äôre doing this. || I can totally relate to you and wish I could provide some words of wisdom, but I to have/am struggling. Currently, I teeter between plant-based and not. At home, not a problem...but traveling and visiting friends/family, especially around holidays has been difficult. Wish you luck! || You don't say where you come from, but there might be some people from your country reading this who would have some suggestions. I've traveled a bit internationally, mostly Latin America, and everywhere have found a few traditional dishes that have no or little meat. Exploring foods from other cultures opens up a whole range of possibilities.

Regarding coffee, I have always enjoyed it black, no milk of any kind. You might try an espresso, many people find them quite delicious. || It can be very hard. I have the same problem with cheese that you have with milk. The vegan versions don't taste good. I wish there was a solution but there is hope for the future. New research is being done to make the substitutes better || It's rough when we're taught to eat differently, but it's a massive step for your health. So give yourself all the time you need.


You probably already tried soy milk, so I would say stick with a tolerable plant milk and let your taste buds adapt, it usually takes a month for people who don't like broccoli to end up liking it. So maybe start with small doses. Plant milks will never be the same as cow's milk, because they don't have all the fat and natural hormones which I would consider a positive. || I found that turning it into adventure was really helpful for me. I had the benefit of being a picky eater in general, so that kind of helped me because I knew that most likely I wouldn't like many of the things I was trying. 

I went into trying new things with low expectations and then would be pleasantly surprised when I actually did like something. I have tried many of the plant milks and so far are the only two that passed the test are in the oatley that comes in a blue box and Califia, They also have a full fat and DHA added, which makes it very close to milk. I tried Califia the other day and it was also very good.

I'm also very lucky to have a family that is open to trying new things. I wonder if someone in your family might be willing to try a new recipe and cook it with you?. || I slowly transitioned from vegetarian to vegan over the course of a three month period. Don‚Äôt pressure yourself to make the change overnight if you feel it won‚Äôt be sustainable. Start by replacing the animal products that are ‚Äúeasier‚Äù for you to remove from your diet. In the mean time, I highly suggest diving deeper into the realities of the animal agriculture industry, especially the dairy industry. I watched Gary Yourofsky‚Äôs ‚ÄòBest Speech You Will Ever Hear‚Äô which solidified my why and pushed me to stop eating animals altogether. Almost 10 years later, and while part of me wishes I went vegan sooner, I know that if I didn‚Äôt come to that decision on my own, from an empowered and passionate place, it may not have been sustainable. Go at your own pace, but also be honest with yourself about what your dollars are funding in the meantime. || Have you tried cashew milk? I find I hate other milk alternatives but like cashew milk. It‚Äôs also fairly easily to make yourself! || For everything I recommend doing a mix. Like for milk of you dont like the flavor of one but you like the texture of the other, mix them! A almond soy milk could be better than just almond or soy for example. For meats and cheeses too, if you use multiple  things to try to replicate it at once it'll be closer to what you want. Just experiment with whatever alternatives you have and remember spices are your friend and so is fat, olive oil and other vegan sources of fat will make the meals feel just as indulgent as meaty ones! I grew up vegetarian but had to learn how to cook all the meals I shouldve grown up on when I realized that flavor can still be with plants ü§îüòÖ and even my grandma who says ""a porkchop is a porkchop don't bring that vegan stuff around me"" will happily eat anything I make at this stage of my cooking; its just about practice!",8,vegan,2025-08-21 12:58:06,trying vegan,hi really trying vegan need advices struggled transition vegetarian one month preetty okay got home parents food different compared eat prepare come country wich traditional food related lot meat wich applies lot countries ofc feel comes shapes grew really hard eat comes milk tried everything oat rice coconut wheat almond like drink coffee milk like kind milk make pancakes works almond milk want vegan justice animals really really hard wish someone could give tips tricks really helpful maybe something niche helped thank,educate realities diary meat industry hate idea indulging milk get used taste oat soy milk time never want go back especially know stealing milk mother baby starves try different brands plant based milks find one like sounds like addiction continue avoid animal products tastes go along changes eating family challenge many people consuming animals issue kind around world ok forget labels make slow transition milk problem stop eating goes easily leave milk last step give time comes family going outs always problem vegan case bodybuilder disorder related diet got religious food restrictions even want stop drinking alcohol people face issue visiting hosting family get comes point veganism gets hard many times make sacrifices compromises stuff previously loved took granted tough letting things go think point though gives personal journey veganism meaning easy anyone inch empathy animals would easy okay test mettle commitment cause since starting struggling quite bit suggest transition people cold turkey fine like others need take time okay keep reminding totally relate wish could provide words wisdom struggling currently teeter plant based home problem traveling visiting friends family especially around holidays difficult wish luck say come might people country reading would suggestions traveled bit internationally mostly latin america everywhere found traditional dishes little meat exploring foods cultures opens whole range possibilities regarding coffee always enjoyed black milk kind might try espresso many people find quite delicious hard problem cheese milk vegan versions taste good wish solution hope future new research done make substitutes better rough taught eat differently massive step health give time need probably already tried soy milk would say stick tolerable plant milk let taste buds adapt usually takes month people like broccoli end liking maybe start small doses plant milks never cow milk fat natural hormones would consider positive found turning adventure really helpful benefit picky eater general kind helped knew likely like many things trying went trying new things low expectations would pleasantly surprised actually like something tried many plant milks far two passed test oatley comes blue box califia also full fat dha added makes close milk tried califia day also good also lucky family open trying new things wonder someone family might willing try new recipe cook slowly transitioned vegetarian vegan course three month period pressure make change overnight feel sustainable start replacing animal products easier remove diet mean time highly suggest diving deeper realities animal agriculture industry especially dairy industry watched gary yourofsky best speech ever hear solidified pushed stop eating animals altogether almost years later part wishes went vegan sooner know come decision empowered passionate place may sustainable go pace also honest dollars funding meantime tried cashew milk find hate milk alternatives like cashew milk also fairly easily make everything recommend mix like milk dont like flavor one like texture mix almond soy milk could better almond soy example meats cheeses use multiple things try replicate closer want experiment whatever alternatives remember spices friend fat olive oil vegan sources fat make meals feel indulgent meaty ones grew vegetarian learn cook meals shouldve grown realized flavor still plants even grandma says porkchop porkchop bring vegan stuff around happily eat anything make stage cooking practice
wanting to be vegan but unsure where to start,"hiii I've been watching documentaries about the meat industry and made the decision that I can't accept eating meat in my diet for much longer. However, when trying to convert to veganism I feel kind of overwhelmed. I'm asking for advice /tips on how most people here initially made the first jump. My reasoning is I have vegan friends and I enjoy vegan food and they encouraged me to research the industry more, but I thought asking a wider community was smarter to do at first ! thank you for any advice ‚ô°","i recommend looking up recipes you like but vegan and just buying vegan stuff the next time you go grocery shopping. you can eat through your non vegan stuff you already have if you want, but you don‚Äôt have to unless you‚Äôre on a budget or something. but just shopping only vegan stuff is the easiest way to start. Once you get good recipes you like it‚Äôs easy ;) learning to cook more is crucial for being vegan. if you want any of my go to easy recipes feel free to ask :) i‚Äôm pretty lazy so my foods easy lol || Welcome to the resistance (the future is vegan and you will be on the right side of history)¬†

The main thing is to start checking labels. If it contains animal harm then put it back and check a different brand or product.¬†

Non processed foods are easy becuase we know a potatoes vegan. But when you buy fries they should just be vegan but sometimes they contain animal products. Most of the time you can find alternatives. One of the things I really miss is strawberry shortcake rolls (super junk food vibes) however, I already have multiple recipes to make them at home if I neeeeeeed to have some.¬†

You got this ! || I would ask your vegan friends for help, I'm sure they would love to help on the journey! It's not just about sharing recipes and giving tips for supermarket shopping, any sort of lifestyle change is easier when you have a community behind you. Host a vegan dinner for them or pick out a vegan restaurant to try together. It really makes the transition easier when you feel like you're not alone. || Here is a [vegan guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xNmOMLmjJ6yAC4TcE4xENuJ0pNn12rby/view?usp=drivesdk) I made with a few partners! I hope it is helpful, it‚Äôs pretty in depth and includes recipes we enjoy! || Start with vegan dishes you already like. Build your menus around those. || Simnet Nutrition on YT makes meal ideas easy || Get into the habit of reading labels and start looking for vegan swaps for nonvegan things you already eat. For example, try soy or oat milk instead of dairy, or try a lentil sloppy joe or bolognese where you'd usually use beef (and if the first swap you try doesn't work out, take note and then try a different one because things like alt milks and meats can be very brand-dependent). And also browse some vegan recipe blogs and just see what appeals to you; some vegan foods might be nothing like anything meat-based that you've had before, but this is a perfect time to expand your diet. Once you're fully or mostly plant-based, track your meals in the app Cronometer for a week or so to see if there's anything you're missing out on, and adjust your diet or supplement as necessary. At a minimum, though, you need to be supplementing B12. 

One caveat on the ""find swaps for things you like"" ‚Äî if you're big on cheese, I personally would recommend quitting it altogether and then waiting a little while before you try vegan cheese. There are some decent vegan cheeses out there, but I haven't found any that are quite like dairy and if you're discerning, you might not like them if you're comparing them to their dairy counterparts. || For starters well done on that first step of educating yourself on it. Some may not agree but don‚Äôt burn yourself out with watching a load of gruesome videos, it‚Äôs important to know what happens but don‚Äôt get yourself down because it can a lot to take in and sad to realise the practises that are allowed for the taste and texture of something.

Not being pedantic either but if you‚Äôre looking to be vegan you need to consider products and clothing as well as food. If you‚Äôre looking to be on a plant based diet then there should be a vegan version of most of your favourite meals out there.

If it veganism then I started by making a list of all of the things I would  need to change: toiletries, house products etc. then once you start googling things it becomes quite easy and you start knowing what ingredients/companies to look out for, double checking wool isn‚Äôt in clothes and wine it‚Äôs filtered through a cow etc. don‚Äôt be shy to ask your friends either no shame in not having all of the answers. || Start by swapping familiar foods like dairy milk for oat or soy milk, and meat for beans or tofu in dishes you already love, like tacos or stir-fries. Batch-prep easy meals like vegan chili or grain bowls to reduce stress, and stock your pantry with staples like lentils, rice, and hummus. Lean on your vegan friends for recipe ideas and use apps like HappyCow for support. This approach, common among new vegans, keeps things practical and sustainable while aligning with your ethical goals. || So much great advice here! Want to add that we're proud of you! Starting on a vegan journey may have some gray areas early on and that's okay. Keep moving forward and remember why You make the Choices You make. Again, always be kind to yourself (and those around you too ‚ò∫Ô∏è) || The first thing I did was go out for a falafel wrap instead of a cheeseburger. After that it was experimenting with a few new recipes at home. A big pot of 3-bean chili quickly became a staple. These days the mix at home includes a simple but delicious french lentil soup, a simple version of gado-gado, or a can of black beans heated on the stove served with bread and a beer or glass of red wine. || The start of veganism is a very blurry thing, usually it's some relationship you have to an animal at a young age, realizing that they are incredibly caring, or full of joy, or actually thinking. Most people leave it there. 

After that, however long that is, it can be a decision to cut down or cut out animal products from your diet. Idk, what I'm really saying is that you've already started by just caring. You don't have to define your veganism for it to have a positive impact on yourself or the world.

Whatever you do, don't be too hard on yourself, you've already been eating meat for the whole of your life, at this point it's only a matter of claiming that decision for yourself, whatever it means for you.",17,vegan,2025-08-19 10:52:25,wanting vegan unsure start,hiii watching documentaries meat industry made decision accept eating meat diet much longer however trying convert veganism feel kind overwhelmed asking advice tips people initially made first jump reasoning vegan friends enjoy vegan food encouraged research industry thought asking wider community smarter first thank advice,recommend looking recipes like vegan buying vegan stuff next time go grocery shopping eat non vegan stuff already want unless budget something shopping vegan stuff easiest way start get good recipes like easy learning cook crucial vegan want go easy recipes feel free ask pretty lazy foods easy lol welcome resistance future vegan right side history main thing start checking labels contains animal harm put back check different brand product non processed foods easy becuase know potatoes vegan buy fries vegan sometimes contain animal products time find alternatives one things really miss strawberry shortcake rolls super junk food vibes however already multiple recipes make home neeeeeeed got would ask vegan friends help sure would love help journey sharing recipes giving tips supermarket shopping sort lifestyle change easier community behind host vegan dinner pick vegan restaurant try together really makes transition easier feel like alone vegan guide made partners hope helpful pretty depth includes recipes enjoy start vegan dishes already like build menus around simnet nutrition yt makes meal ideas easy get habit reading labels start looking vegan swaps nonvegan things already eat example try soy oat milk instead dairy try lentil sloppy joe bolognese usually use beef first swap try work take note try different one things like alt milks meats brand dependent also browse vegan recipe blogs see appeals vegan foods might nothing like anything meat based perfect time expand diet fully mostly plant based track meals app cronometer week see anything missing adjust diet supplement necessary minimum though need supplementing b one caveat find swaps things like big cheese personally would recommend quitting altogether waiting little try vegan cheese decent vegan cheeses found quite like dairy discerning might like comparing dairy counterparts starters well done first step educating may agree burn watching load gruesome videos important know happens get lot take sad realise practises allowed taste texture something pedantic either looking vegan need consider products clothing well food looking plant based diet vegan version favourite meals veganism started making list things would need change toiletries house products etc start googling things becomes quite easy start knowing ingredients companies look double checking wool clothes wine filtered cow etc shy ask friends either shame answers start swapping familiar foods like dairy milk oat soy milk meat beans tofu dishes already love like tacos stir fries batch prep easy meals like vegan chili grain bowls reduce stress stock pantry staples like lentils rice hummus lean vegan friends recipe ideas use apps like happycow support approach common among new vegans keeps things practical sustainable aligning ethical goals much great advice want add proud starting vegan journey may gray areas early okay keep moving forward remember make choices make always kind around first thing go falafel wrap instead cheeseburger experimenting new recipes home big pot bean chili quickly became staple days mix home includes simple delicious french lentil soup simple version gado gado black beans heated stove served bread beer glass red wine start veganism blurry thing usually relationship animal young age realizing incredibly caring full joy actually thinking people leave however long decision cut cut animal products diet idk really saying already started caring define veganism positive impact world whatever hard already eating meat whole life point matter claiming decision whatever means

I want to live as a vegan but physically cannot. What do I do?,"I‚Äôve wanted to live vegan for years, but my body literally will not allow it. I‚Äôm not exaggerating. I have multiple autoimmune conditions, but on top of that I have severe GI disorders and food intolerances. I can‚Äôt digest most legumes without ending up in the ER. Soy triggers anaphylaxis. Gluten destroys my gut. I have inflammatory bowel disease and gastroparesis, so even high-fiber vegetables can cause blockages. Nuts make me violently sick. Seeds and whole grains barely process.

When I‚Äôve tried to stick to plant products, I‚Äôve lost dangerous amounts of weight and ended up in the hospital with malnutrition. Multiple doctors and dietitians have told me that if I tried to stay strictly vegan, I would eventually die from complications. That‚Äôs not an opinion, it‚Äôs been medically documented in my case.

So I‚Äôm stuck. Every animal product I eat feels like a moral failure, but I physically cannot survive without them. It isn‚Äôt about willpower or commitment‚Äîit‚Äôs about my body not being able to handle the food that would sustain a vegan diet.

Sometimes I catch myself wondering in a purely hypothetical sense if it would be better for the world if I just wasn‚Äôt alive. I‚Äôm not suicidal, but I do think about the fact that my survival comes at the cost of animal lives, and it eats at me.

So what do I do? If I can‚Äôt live on a vegan diet, how can I still live aligned with vegan values? Is there a place in this movement for people like me who want this lifestyle but literally can‚Äôt eat the diet without dying? ","Personally if i were in your shoes I would be making appointments with a registered dietician and a vegan doctor, there are GI clinics on board with plant based lifestyles people on board with my desire to be vegan.  If you cant, of course you have to survive and there are other things you can try to do help animals, like donations, activism, volunteering, adoption, etc, and never buy animal products from factory farms or eat at restaurants that do, never but leather, wool, fur, or feathers, etc. || ‚ÄúVeganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude‚Äîas far as is possible and practicable‚Äîall forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment. In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals.‚Äù

By this definition, if you physically can‚Äôt exclude all animal products, meaning it isn‚Äôt possible, you can still be vegan while eating animal products. Just do the best you can while maintaining your health, continue to try (safely) new vegan things to substitute animal products. Maybe try Huel?

Edit: What is morally required of you is only what is possible. Don‚Äôt feel shame or guilt about what you can‚Äôt control. Think about it, if it is impossible, you are not responsible, you cannot be responsible. || Im just glad your contemplating instead of the hate and stubbornness || I'd check in with a vegan dietician, but if they couldn't troubleshoot it enough, I would do what I had to to maintain health. || Work with a vegan RD and a vegan doctor to help you out with this.

your health always comes first. :) || Also look into FODMAP (monash university) there‚Äôs also Facebook vegan fodmap groups and there‚Äôs folks who have similar conditions as you. Good luck. || Are you sure ¬†you‚Äôd ‚Äúliterally die‚Äù on a vegan diet?¬†

¬†Whole plant foods might not work for you. legumes, soy, nuts, seeds, and high-fiber veg are rough with gastroparesis/IBD. ¬†but people in your situation can survive on combinations of white rice, peeled potatoes, fruit purees, refined starches, oils, and rice or potato protein isolates, elemental vegan formulas (Kate Farms, ¬†etc), and fortified supplements.¬†

On top of that, precision fermented proteins like Perfect Day‚Äôs whey and cultivated meat offer animal identical nutrition without harming animals. It wouldn‚Äôt be easy, cheap, or fun.

but saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù skips over the fact that vegan-compatible survival diets and technologies do exists.¬† || Please do not feel guilty. You have to eat what you need to eat to not just survive, but thrive. That you care enough about animal welfare to get into serious physical trouble trying to honor them shows your dedication, but of course it's not sustainable. 

My situation isn't quite as severe as yours, but I also have multiple autoimmune disorders and a lack of digestive enzymes so lots of food intolerances and anaphylactic type reactions to foods that are high in histamine. 

I believe the autoimmune stuff IS a gut issue. My opinion, and some science is beginning to back this up, is that gut biome plays the crucial role in the development of these disorders. Unfortunately, many of these disorders also cause us to not absorb nutrition correctly. I have to have B12 injections, for instance. But autoimmune disease is frequently tied to gut issues, which I find fascinating.

With that in mind, I started working on my gut biome. After quite a few months I find I can tolerate some high FODMAP and histamine foods I'd been unable to tolerate in the past. Just food for thought, no pun intended.

Maybe it would help you to get your meat from ethical sources? If I had to eat meat, I'd much rather eat a deer that was killed instantly than any kind of industrial agriculture sourced animal. || Given that this is clearly written by AI, I'm having a hard time believing you didn't just tell ChatGPT to come up with the best health excuses not to be vegan, and to write a post about it.

**It isn't about X or Y (em dash) it's about Z.**

Obvious AI formatting. At this point just copy-paste your post back into AI and have it tell you what to do. || You‚Äôre outsourcing justification from a vegan group. If you‚Äôd ‚Äúliterally die‚Äù if you were vegan, you wouldn‚Äôt need to make yourself feel better by asking people on Reddit if that‚Äôs okay or if you should just ‚Äúliterally die‚Äù || Have you talked to vegan doctors, actual ethical doctors not doctors who are on plant based diets?

The simple solution for non vegan docs is to not be vegan, they dont care about animals so you consuming them is no issue for them and thus there is nothing more to try, a vegan doc doesnt want you to do that so they will probably spend more time looking into other options

Do you not go to restaurants due to the severity of your issues? A steak might be fine but they could use some other ingredients for flavor that you cant have

Lets say you cant digest plant proteins, in this case it would be best to hire a hunter to kill a single animal in the most painless way possible and that will be where you get your protein

You could also fish, and then kill them right away, thats another source of protein

This would mean you would be vegan since you are causing the least harm, most people would use their medical issues as an excuse to just buy watever they want, contribute to the cruel animal farming etc;

Understandably, you cannot be vegan for health reasons; there is no need for you to post here and say this. || This is where consulting a plant based dietician might help. You named a lot of vegan foods you can't have, but there are still vegan foods you can have. There are plenty of low fiber fruits and vegetables you can eat in cooked form (how do you handle rice and potatoes?). There are vegan mock meats not made from soy or gluten (Beyond meats are made from pea protein). What does your current diet look like? || .... you go as vegan as you can. That's basically what all of us are doing. Don't make justifications for when you fuck up. Just do your best, learn what you can, and stay focused on both what is realistic, and what is real. You *can* do this and you will likely have to learn stuff for yourself that others haven't figured out yet, or that isn't easily accessible yet. Then you should tell others how you did it. In this way you make it easier for the next person like you who is suffering and struggling to do what they feel is right. 

Good luck sibling. You're doing just fine. || I would look into these guys. Some of those things mentioned can be healed, and just because your body has a reaction to something now, doesn't mean it will have to forever. üíö

https://www.highcarbhealth.com/ || >I've lost dangerous amounts of weight

Were you only eating carrots? || Please, could you guys not be fundamentalists? I've been vegan for almost seven years, it's the most important thing in my life. This person is sharing that they can die because of certain foods and you're still pushing them to eat vegan when they obviously can't. It's ugly and unfair. They are asking for other ways to contribute and for some support. || Do what makes you feel your best, first.

That said, all of the suggestions about minimizing cruelty are great ways of contributing. Vegan is more than a diet. Find a Registered Dietitian (not a nutritionist) who is willing to work with you. RDs have clinical training, and many have specialized training. Perhaps you can find one who specializes in plant-based eating. It sounds like you have some debilitating health issues causing you serious distress. 

Side suggestion: if you can use it, are not allergic, and are not taking any contraindicated medications, try adding turmeric with black pepper, as a supplement. It is proven, in studies, to help a whole host of health issues, and is a powerful anti-inflammatory supplement. Look it up. See if it is recommended for use with any of the conditions you have.

I wish you luck on your journey. || It's ok. I feel like if you choose the vegan option every time it's safe to do so, that's enough <3 I get it, it's hard to feel this way and still have to consume animal products, but your life is

A genie gives you 3 wishes‚Ä¶,"What three wishes would result in the most people going vegan in the next year? 
We know from every story with a genie that they‚Äôre slippery devils who will take advantage of loopholes, so I‚Äôm avoiding the obvious ‚Äúeveryone goes vegan overnight‚Äù. I‚Äôm also thinking about the unfortunate tiny minority of humans who are allergic to both legumes and nuts. Here are three I‚Äôve thought of: 
1. Every health professional in the world starts whole-heartedly recommending a plant-based diet. 
2. Every human comes to understand that embracing veganism will be the most impactful thing they can do for the environment as an individual. 
3. Every human develops the level of compassion and understanding necessary for them to embrace veganism. 
What 3 wishes would you ask for? ","yeah, I wouldn't want three wishes. Genies are sneaky. You might ask that everyone become vegan overnight and then everyone turns into a cow. And the world is covered in grass and all we do is eat the grass all day long. || 1. Animal abuse no longer exists. That means you can't kill animals ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è done. 

Then I wish for other stuff || Call me selfish, but I'd personally spend at least one of the wishes on fixing my own health (and anyone else with major/chronic illnesses) || Every vegan alternative tastes better would be a good place to start. || > 3.	‚Å†Every human develops the level of compassion and understanding necessary for them to embrace veganism. What 3 wishes would you ask for?

I would say three because it‚Äôs best for the planet as well as the individual. || 1. Animals are given a bill of rights in all countries.

2. The entire world becomes one large democracy using a rated voting system with explicit liberties. 

3. Microsoft goes bankrupt. || 1. Competition (specifically capitalism) is immediately abolished in favor of resource sharing and community based care

2. Ending unethical mass production in favor of sustainable minimal production (including the production of plastic as entirely as possible and every single use object in existence)

3. Humans live in harmony with nature and cease to exploit it as they understand that we are all made of the same material and share the same inherent desire to support one another

(Basically I want everyone to read Braiding Sweetgrass and take it to heart lol)

These could all be byproducts of one another but I wanted to be thorough <3 || My wishes would be

Human centric walkable (no car) regenerative net zero high density cities with tons of green spaces for every person that exists, includes mass transit and close loop modular production systems. 

Next would be humans age to 25 physically and then stay that way and healthy forever if they eat a vegan diet.

And finally that all humans would benefit equally from productivity gains because we now have a technocratic government overseen by social workers. || 1) Everyone becomes allergic to animal products. 2)They feel the same pain they afflict on animals and others 3) vegetables and fruit become super cheap || I don't have serious answer but I have one philosophycally interesting. 

1. Since tomorrow, at the every end of a day, everyone experiences exactly as much physical and mental pain as they caused by their decisions made during that day. Both, directly and indirectly.
2. A chair.
3. A popcorn.

Then I would observe how consequentialism moral system is doing. || Those are nicely crafted wishes.

Another could be: every human would be ethically opposed to eating dead animals or animal embroys. || 1. I wish the the big bang never happened || 1)wish that in all realities, timelines, dimensions, and possible universes, no being, living or otherwise, conscious or unconscious, now or in the future, shall ever have the capacity to experience any form of suffering, including but not limited to pain, discomfort, distress, fear, anxiety, grief, sadness, boredom, frustration, or dissatisfaction, regardless of origin, intensity, or duration. This elimination shall be permanent, absolute, and immune to reversal, loophole, or indirect causation.


2) wish that if, at any point in the future, any being in any reality, dimension, or timeline gains the capacity to experience suffering in any form, all life, consciousness, and potential for life or consciousness in all realities shall instantly and permanently cease to exist without possibility of return. || The end of all human life. || 1. every restaurant only supplies vegan options and places specifically named or based around meat (KFC, Steakhouse, etc) close down.
2. every product in the supermarket, food/beauty/household/etc is cruelty free and vegan too.
3. all humans grow out of their carnist mindset and realise how wrong and horrible and unethical meat and dairy farming and animal abuse is.",9,vegan,2025-08-15 10:15:08,genie gives wishes,three wishes would result people going vegan next year know every story genie slippery devils take advantage loopholes avoiding obvious everyone goes vegan overnight also thinking unfortunate tiny minority humans allergic legumes nuts three thought every health professional world starts whole heartedly recommending plant based diet every human comes understand embracing veganism impactful thing environment individual every human develops level compassion understanding necessary embrace veganism wishes would ask,yeah want three wishes genies sneaky might ask everyone become vegan overnight everyone turns cow world covered grass eat grass day long animal abuse longer exists means kill animals done wish stuff call selfish personally spend least one wishes fixing health anyone else major chronic illnesses every vegan alternative tastes better would good place start every human develops level compassion understanding necessary embrace veganism wishes would ask would say three best planet well individual animals given bill rights countries entire world becomes one large democracy using rated voting system explicit liberties microsoft goes bankrupt competition specifically capitalism immediately abolished favor resource sharing community based care ending unethical mass production favor sustainable minimal production including production plastic entirely possible every single use object existence humans live harmony nature cease exploit understand made material share inherent desire support one another basically want everyone read braiding sweetgrass take heart lol could byproducts one another wanted thorough wishes would human centric walkable car regenerative net zero high density cities tons green spaces every person exists includes mass transit close loop modular production systems next would humans age physically stay way healthy forever eat vegan diet finally humans would benefit equally productivity gains technocratic government overseen social workers everyone becomes allergic animal products feel pain afflict animals others vegetables fruit become super cheap serious answer one philosophycally interesting since tomorrow every end day everyone experiences exactly much physical mental pain caused decisions made day directly indirectly chair popcorn would observe consequentialism moral system nicely crafted wishes another could every human would ethically opposed eating dead animals animal embroys wish big bang never happened wish realities timelines dimensions possible universes living otherwise conscious unconscious future shall ever capacity experience form suffering including limited pain discomfort distress fear anxiety grief sadness boredom frustration dissatisfaction regardless origin intensity duration elimination shall permanent absolute immune reversal loophole indirect causation wish point future reality dimension timeline gains capacity experience suffering form life consciousness potential life consciousness realities shall instantly permanently cease exist without possibility return end human life every restaurant supplies vegan options places specifically named based around meat kfc steakhouse etc close every product supermarket food beauty household etc cruelty free vegan humans grow carnist mindset realise wrong horrible unethical meat dairy farming animal abuse
How to convince someone to go vegan? (School project survey!),"A friend of mine is working on a research project about what actually convinces people to go vegan. We're trying to figure out:

* What actually worked when you got someone to go vegan
* How much you‚Äôre willing to adapt your message to get results
* What you do when empathy, facts, and good food still don‚Äôt make a difference

We made a short survey to collect responses and will be sharing the results with the community. If you‚Äôve ever been successful (or not) in trying to change someone‚Äôs mind, I‚Äôd love to hear what worked for you (or didn't). I hope it's okay to share here.

**Here's the survey:** [**https://share.formgrid.com/Mgd7wO59hzdexwtE**](https://share.formgrid.com/Mgd7wO59hzdexwtE)

Thanks a lot in advance, every response helps!","\#1 reason is getting people to make connection between the animals they are eating and the animals they love, cherish and grants rights to. Ask them if they've ever been loved by an animal and what they would do to protect that animal should someone try to eat them for xyz reasons. It's extremely powerful || I have many thoughts about vegan advocacy. For context, I have done lots of it over many years.

* **Most people need to be exposed to new/ different lifestyles multiple times before they start to feel realistic options for themselves. One exposure is not enough.** If you're the first vegan someone has ever actually met and talked to, you might well be part of what inspires them to go vegan but it might take a few years and many other vegans for them to get there.
* **Most of the people you advocate veganism to will not go vegan. That's just a fact. It's a numbers game.** So if you fail and fail and fail and fail it doesn't mean your methods don't work, it's just the luck of the draw. At some point you'd want to reconsider your methods but often you just need to reach a critical mass to have any impact at all.
* **There are two parts to vegan advocacy and people need to hear both parts. They are the WHY and the HOW.** Many times, vegans are better suited to one part or the other. It's really good to recognize that this isn't a competition and that every vegan advocate needs other vegan advocates to help.
* **I think it's very helpful to try to meet people where they are at and try to appeal to their interests**, not to ours or animals'. When you're talking to people you can often gauge what about a plant based diet or what about veganism might appeal to them and then try to discuss that aspect with them. Or if you're not well suited for that topic, find someone who is.
* **Many people can be convinced to eat less meat even if they can't be convinced to go vegan.** I think that's still often a win for animals, the animal rights movement, and vegans. So don't let perfect be the enemy of good. Try to encourage some change in behavior even if it's not full veganism.
* **Some people are better with incremental change and others are better with big sudden changes.** The evidence for long lasting change seems to support incremental as more sustainable but don't be afraid to push for overnight change if it seems like it's the best option for that person (like other changes they've made for the better have been overnight types of changes). || The [Better Food Foundation](https://www.betterfoodfoundation.org/research-and-reports/) has got a lot of research and info on ‚Äúbehavioral nudges‚Äù and such to encourage and normalize plant based eating. They also have some programs for students to work with them to bring plant-based defaults & nudges to your school campus. I‚Äôm currently enrolled in their program for my college and I‚Äôve already gotten Plant-Based Defaults & Nudges added to our campus Food Committee meeting agenda when the committee reconvenes in the fall :) || I'll tell you what not to do: Confrontation doesn't work with people with fragile egos.
So how to make someone understand depends a lot on who that person is too. || What worked for me is not being a dumb bitch and researching myself on what I consume. So I researched a lot, watched movies, heard the screams and brutality of animals. The screams still haunt me years later.

Then I got a bad feeling each time I consumed animal products. In less than 1 month I became fully vegan.



Edit: some people don't care about animals, they don't have empathy because they see animals as less than us, some even say they are here FOR us humans. There is no changing them I think.

Some people don't care about animals but also don't wanna be the reason they get hurt, so that's a reason on what others may brought to veganism. || You've got to know the person, and tailor your conversation to them.

Do they care about the environment?  Casually deforestation and methane release.

Do they like animals?  Mention how the industry standards that the meat and dairy industry tout are based on rubbish and aren't enforced.

The goal to start with is to get them to consume less animal products, not to be a vegan right off the bat. 

Be a friend to them and show that it makes sense to their ideals not to eat meat. || From experience, trying to ‚Äúconvert‚Äù someone aggressively or making them feel like a bad person doesn‚Äôt work. They just get annoyed and/or upset with you. Do NOT send them gore videos either. 

Using empathy and encouraging people to REDUCE the amount of meat they eat or participating in meatless-Monday is a good start. If it‚Äôs feasible and not stressful to the individual, they‚Äôre more likely to slowly reduce their animal product consumption. || I don't know that I've ever been successful in getting someone to go vegan. I've gotten lots of people to eat vegan dinners for a while, and a couple to go vegan for 2 months or so, but the only real success I've had is helping someone who was already on their way. Like, pointing someone towards resources, literature, and recipes. || i have only ever made people be vegan by bringing up the facts & holding them accountable. || People are very prideful.

If you make them feel like they're ""losing,"" ""evil,"" or ""dumb,"" they're unlikely to change their minds.

**Hence, a good psychological tool is flattery and empowerment.** Make them feel that they are ""open-minded"" and ""reasonable."" Tell them you admire their ability to be courageous, think independently, and buck the status quo. If-and-when they change, they need to feel like they were the ones who initiated the change.

Also, be relatable. Most of us (including myself) were once carnists. Remark that they can ""get it faster than you did.""

What I like to do (in the rare situation where it's appropriate to really try to convert someone) is to start with...

> ""I get it. I used to live my life prioritizing other things. I cared about school, work, a career, dating. When it came to injustices, I focused on those humans wrought on each other. I always had a certain degree of compassion for animals and I think I was a pretty good person, despite that moral blindspot for the carnism-veganism conflict. Once I turned my attention to veganism and nonhuman animal ethics, I recognized I needed to change. And you're probably in a similar boat. You'll get it quicker than me.""

Something like that.

**Another good entry point is to chip away at carnism bit by bit by obtaining increasingly impactful concessions...**

* foie gras, veal, and the leather and fur industries are particularly cruel
* we don't need to test shampoos and cosmetics on animals
* we don't need to use animals in circuses (and circuses have a long history of animal abuse)
* factory farming is wrong in all kinds of overtly cruel ways
* domesticated animals and ""pets"" should have rights and protections, including those which would safeguard them from abuse and neglect 
* *en masse* animal exploitation is also very bad for the environment
* a well balanced plant-based diet is better than the average carnist diet; a strict health-focused plant-based diet tops a strict health-focused carnist diet; the less meat, dairy, and eggs, the better 
* humans almost certainly needed to exploit animals in order to survive in the past; back then, our moral obligation (which we did not meet) was to cause as little pain and suffering as possible; nowadays, can't at least some people thrive without using animal-based foods and products? can't you?
* and so on...

**My successes:**

* my younger brother went vegan
* an ex went vegan (right before we started dating; we were friends before)
* my other family and friends have become much more vegan-friendly, even experimenting with periods of veganism; most of them have now greatly reduced their consumption of animal-based foods; some are on the precipice of permanent conversion || Make great food || I did the survey, but just something I‚Äôm surprised you didn‚Äôt ask‚Ä¶ why not ask what changed *us*? A tiny percent of vegans were raised vegan, so isn‚Äôt the catalyst for our change the best example of what actually works? || By being a good example. || [By holding them accountable.](https://youtu.be/d-kkigyxmGk?si=cYp9edT_6nKR7WGt) || you can adapt to how they are and what they care or pretend to care about but nothing actually ""works"". they'll only go vegan if they care about animals enough in the first place (most do not) and whatever you say will just be a push in that direction. || Just use facts and have the person try and justify their position on why animal product consumption is justified and not an atrocity. Anyone with empathy and the capacity to self-reflect will eventually realise how poor the justifications are and how much suffering they cause, and will eventually change when that realisation causes them enough suffering that they are willing to stop consuming animal products to do better. You can also use the logic of their own arguments against them to justify acts they would consider otherwise immoral, and point out their hypocrisy, although there will be a lot of supremacist thinking and cognitive dissonance going on, so don't expect any immediate changes in somebody who hasn't considered veganism before. I also don't express any hatred since I don't believe in any kind of moral responsibility either. Don't try to blame them for doing something bad, have them realise what they are doing is harmful and make sure you are arguing for the sake of the victim, not condemning the person you are supposed to convince. || Cook something really delicious and give it to them along with the recipe. People hear ""plant-based"", ""tofu"" etc. and assume it tastes bad. Give them something they actually want to try at home. || Becoming vegan is a big cultural change for most people, especially since food plays a big role in family traditions and religious celebrations. You can‚Äôt make that huge of a change without getting them to reframe the way they view animals as food. If you watch a documentary, any documentary, what they do is they reframe the issue by presenting facts. Yes they do it selectively to create a perspective (which might not be the popular view). Once people understand that alternative perspective they become more open to change, and may even reevaluate their own behavior.
I never try to change anybody‚Äôs mind or convert them. What I might do is to say ‚Äúif you would like to understand why I eat this way please take the time to watch 90 minutes of a documentary. If they‚Äôre young and they view athletic performance (and male virility) as being important I will ask them to watch The Game Ghangers. If they are older adults, I would ask them to watch Forks Over Knives because it focuses more on the health aspects of eating whole food plant based. One or the other is likely to resonate. As for the ethical and environmental considerations - both documentaries spend time on that and it‚Äôs enough.  The people who are most likely to stick with a dietary change are people who have more than one reason to do it. || A decent vegan cookbook would go a long way for a lot of us.


I love to cook and I love to cook vegetables. However, my family has been cooking meat oriented dishes my entire life.


We are products of our environment. If we want people to cook vegan meals, we need vegan cookbooks.


It's been a struggle to come up with vegan dinners for the family. Sheetbakes, stirfry, ratatouille, bean and rice tacos...


You guys have any vegan cookbook suggestions? || Veganism is a cult, an eating disorder and an ineffective solution to the worlds climate and food issues.

So many people talking about lab grown meat are accidentally defending veganism,"Since more and more people are learning about lab grown meat, I‚Äôm seeing the craziest arguments for and against it. 

*So* many people are saying it‚Äôs better than factory farming. 
(Like oh okay‚Ä¶ so non vegans *do* know factory farming is bad??)

I saw one famous fitness influencer say that as soon as lab grown meat is commercialized he is going to switch to that because he knows factory farming is bad.

I saw another influencer say that it‚Äôs unlikely that most people in the U.S are eating factory farmed meat (lol). Then people in the comments letting them know that this is not true, but they weren‚Äôt vegans. 

Just strange seeing so many people accidentally defending veganism, but they aren‚Äôt vegan",">Like oh okay‚Ä¶ so non vegans¬†*do*¬†know factory farming is bad??

My experience is that most people (and I mean like 95-99%) agree that factory farming is bad. They still justify it with the various reasons we have all heard often enough though || I think it's more that they know factory farming is really bad for the environment, which in turn means it's really bad for us. People supporting cultivated meat care more about the sustainability, not so much about the ethics. 

I'm not to keen on lab meat either as it still involves exploiting animals, but it is still much better than factory farming which is horrendous. || Maybe unpopular opinion, but I believe that government regulations are the reason we don‚Äôt have lab grown meat already. This would be the most impactful thing ever for animals. || Most people know. I don't think they are really aware how bad it is. But people are aware that it is bad. It's more of ""The little I do, doesn't matter"" and it's just so normal, that changing or even reducing animal products feels ""unnatural"" to a lot of people. 

Unnatural, not in that's what people say, more like in, eating meat and animal products is so ingrained that it's just how it has to be. Changing once ways is very hard for most people, humans don't like change. Especially when they feel they have to give up something. And that something feels like a big part of their quality of live.  Also most people look away because it feels like you can't change anything anyway. How many times has nestle done something horrific, and how many people buy nestle products anyway, knowing what they did.  It's not that they don't care at all, but I don't think most people feel responsible for their own actions. || it proves people do care - just not enough to go vegan - but they are willing to make changes - if the solution is easy enough. || Yeah, the good old cognitive dissonance. They know it's bad, but they get a kick out of it, so they bury it deep down their minds instead of doing something about it. It's completely insane. || Most people are just genuinely evil but don't really care || Creating safe lab created meat that is the same or lower  price  than normal meat, tastes the same has the same amount of amino acids etc is basically the only hope for ending animal farming. || People fully know factory farming is bad in all kinds of ways. 

The thing they don't know, is how to eat well and get fully satisfied on vegan food only. 

People are afraid to not eat well and go hungry. I think very many view a vegan diet as sad and deprived of a lot of the good stuff. 

We know that's not true, but changing diet is scary. Food is such a basic need. This is why I am such a fan of meatless mondays and other stuff like that. It can give people and eureka moment of realizing "" this vegan food is actually just really good food"". || I see your point and it's a cherry on top of the hypocry cake, BUT we all know what cognitive dissonance is.

People smoke, people drink, people overconsume, people do stupid things that they know aren't objectively right, it's not a surprising notion that people will turn to a less harmful alternative when they don't have to sacrifice anything, but if the point is stating that people do and say contradicting and hypocritical things when it comes to animal exploitation, you did a good job. || Non-vegan here! Most of us know factory farming is bad. That is why we make the excuses you are familiar with. I hope lab grown meat works out.

It‚Äôs just like how most people know that the minerals used to make the phone/computers we are using to post on Reddit was harvested by child slave labor. We don‚Äôt like to talk about it because it‚Äôs uncomfortable and forces us to confront the limits of our own morality. But if there was an industry in its infancy that would replace the slave labor with ethical production and cultivation, most of us would start expressing support for the further development of that industry, because although we‚Äôre not willing to stop using our phones and computers, we would definitely prefer to do it without contributing to an industry of mass exploitation and torture. || Lab grown meat isn't vegan.  It's still cow or chicken or goat or whatever.  It's basically dramatically and selectively cloning animal DNA to make a pile of lifeless meat.

Still uses animal DNA, the biggest difference is you only need a few animals to keep alive to gather the DNA, as opposed to raising herds of animals to slaughter. || Being against factory farming isn't veganism. It's welfarism. || This is something I've learned over the past 14 years abstaining from all animal products - people support systemic change, not personal change. I think we should use that to our advantage and push for cultivated meat, perhaps over aiming to make people vegan. || Ex-plant based here. I know factory farming is bad. I don't eat factory farmed meat, only meat from my own/neighbors livestock that I am confident is raised humanely, or wild game. Opposing factory farming =/= vegan. The reason I was ""plant based"" for 10 years but didn't call myself vegan is I believe animals deserve freedom from suffering, but the concept of speciesism is bonkers. I likely would not switch to lab grown meat because I worked in tissue culture labs and I don't expect lab grown meat to be environmentally sustainable (power draw, single use plastics, inputs from factory farming) but I am open to having my mind changed on that if the industry does take off. Wouldn't stop me from raising livestock though because they serve other purposes on my farm. || I mean it's called helter skelter for a reason¬† || Yeah most meat eaters know the industry is horrible, but just don‚Äôt want to think about it because they like the way meat tastes. I‚Äôm also like that to an extent, I am not vegan, but I don‚Äôt eat mammals and birds. When lab grown meat is widely available I will be first in line to get it. I like the way red meat tastes but I won‚Äôt eat it because of the ethical issues. || What are talking about?

Feeling Down,"Guys ive been vegan for nearly a decade now and I‚Äôll say this is the first time I‚Äôm actually having a wobble in those nearly 10 years. When I started my veganism journey, there wasn‚Äôt many options at all, but with time I‚Äôve seen those grow and grow over the years and it has always filled me with optimism and hope. However, over the last couple of years and especially the last year, I‚Äôve seen so many of these options dry up or no longer cease to exist. So many thriving vegan restaurants have closed. So many fewer options in the supermarket. Now we no longer have a fully vegan 3 michelin starred dining experience. More people are turning their backs to veganism. It just feels hard to keep the hope alive. I know this means that it‚Äôs even more reason to keep going and I know its the right thing, but it‚Äôs so hard not to see things as pointless when things are going the opposite way to what we all hope. Can anyone fill me with some hope or joy? Or just help me get out of this rut? I used to feel quite well accepted within circles as a vegan, but now I feel like I‚Äôm looked at as very weird again. 

Also please no hate, I haven‚Äôt consumed anything non-vegan and i dont think hate will help me mentally right now.","Can you visit a sanctuary, donate or spend time on their social spaces or websites? Seeing the animals living their best lives- the rescued & escapees always warm my heart and reminds me of my commitment || You can always count on me. Ill be vegan even if Im the last person on Earth doing it. Dietary trends swing like a pendulum, today it‚Äôs carnivore and keto, in a few years we‚Äôll be seeing the return of raw vegan girlies making smoothies just like in 2019. Promise, it‚Äôs just a phase.¬† || Hi! I am not from the USA, so the situation might be different. Electricity prices have skyrocketed in the last few years. Many restaurants have had to close ‚Äî not just vegan ones, but ‚Äúregular‚Äù ones, too. I only know this because my parents are friends with an accountant who works with restaurants (and they know other accountants who do the same). So not only do people have less money to spend on eating out, but restaurants are also more expensive to run.

I think we vegans notice when our ideal places close or try to change their menu to stay afloat, but we don't pay attention to other places.

I notice small positive changes. People who couldn't imagine a meal without animal products are now eating lentils, falafel, and tofu. They haven't gone plant-based yet, but the fiber trend is changing their views. || What you‚Äôre feeling is real, things are ¬†bleak in so many ways. But, you‚Äôre not alone now, and never will be.¬†Veganism will persist because justice is a human concept and there will always be humans to champion it, for all.

Sending you good vibes üíö || When I went vegan, there were zero vegan restaurants anywhere near me, and there were virtually no vegan products in stores.  I knew no one who was vegan.  In 31 years, I've seen things expand and contract, and seen restaurants open and close.  Oprah is vegan for 5 minutes, then she's not.  I do see changes and improvements from where things used to be when I started.  The bottom line is, you need to follow your own values and know that YOU are making a difference for the animals, no matter what other people are doing.  And in being vegan, you may have the opportunity to influence others.  Also, check this out and see the impact you're having: [https://thevegancalculator.com/?fbclid=IwAR1Xtf0rTy\_X5x2fXHk1wgUrEKO7vpYgbbLwByvp1ZaEAUROuZt-nB\_jaG4\_aem\_ASeCfyyy1u3N7fSrL-zSBtP10UGIgTjc8z2mjSHd0o-wibBPaAveOGqVOgS0Ajutbjc#calculator](https://thevegancalculator.com/?fbclid=IwAR1Xtf0rTy_X5x2fXHk1wgUrEKO7vpYgbbLwByvp1ZaEAUROuZt-nB_jaG4_aem_ASeCfyyy1u3N7fSrL-zSBtP10UGIgTjc8z2mjSHd0o-wibBPaAveOGqVOgS0Ajutbjc#calculator) || I am so sorry :( sometimes I feel the same way, but then I think that all great changes doesn‚Äôt happen quickly but rather in waves. So I think things might Shift in a negative direction before they start getting better again ü´∂üèº || Something I always turn to is the abolitionist movement took over 50 years and was less popular at the start of the American Civil War than veganism is today. Eventually it will change but we may never see it and simultaneously we may be living in the ‚Äúdrawing of the bow of progress‚Äù pulling progress backwards to trigger launching society forward.

The state of the economy is what we are seeing right now more than anything directly related to veganism || I‚Äôm really sorry you are feeling this way, I also feel a bit alienated as most of my current friends are not vegan and I live in a city were options are limited.

What types of options are you missing the most? I‚Äôm currently looking into starting a holistic supplement brand for vegans as I am very into the fitness and nutrition community, I think that‚Äôs gonna help me connect with more likeminded people and help more people become and stay vegan || What other people do has never been of any interest to me. Even if I am the last vegan on earth, I'd still be a vegan. I doubt that Leonardo Da Vinci, Pythagoras, and Kafka had many, if anyone, around them who were vegan/vegetarian (the word hadn't even been invented yet). Ghandi was an exception as he reportedly grew up in a vegetarian family. 

And if we look around, veganism has not decreased: plant-based food sales increase every year, and the percentage of vegans increases, albeit slowly, every year as well. When I started, there were barely any options except for dedicated restaurants; now, the number of restaurants that have vegan options has increased dramatically. Animal rights groups are constantly getting small wins all the time. People are way more aware of veganism and animal suffering than ever before. || Everyday that an animal goes unharmed is a good day! So if someone is vegan for 10 day or 10 years, it‚Äôs a win! || I think awareness is being spread on the benefits of reduction of meat so this is more in trend than veganism. 

A lot of people are using plant based too as there is a stereotype about veganism which has led to its decline. 

I don't think instagram or tiktok has helped with all the food TIk Toks of  donuts, fried chicken etx.

There is still hope though. I'm a new vegan of 3-4 months so people are still converting. Just remember how weird it is that people are angry about veganism when all we are doing is not wanting to hurt animals. They are angry at us for not wanting to cause pain to animals but it is just projection for most people.

It's like a light bulb moment, but meat and dairy is so ingrained in society it's hard for people to detach from the packets in Supermarkets. || When I went vegan I 30 years ago, barely anyone knew what this was. If I went out I might get chips and black coffee, if I was lucky. Battery hens were the norm. When I went abroad I lived on dry bread, salad and fruit. Now even meat eaters have non dairy milk and veggie/vegan alternatives. People are more flexible about what they eat even if they eat meat. There is greater awareness of the environmental impacts of livestock farming. I don‚Äôt mourn the loss of highly processed low quality food and I‚Äôm pleased I can get tofu, soya milk and yoghurt basically everywhere. There are lots of vegans who don‚Äôt feel the need to buy that stuff‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just consumerism and Big Food. Vegan restaurants are a bit too niche to be financially sustainable, let‚Äôs be real. Even if people are more veggie at home realistically a lot of people want to eat dead animals when they are out as a ‚Äútreat‚Äù. 
The worst thing for veganism as a philosophy is the actions and behaviour of *some* vegans (yeah downvote me I don‚Äôt care). Trying to shame or shock meat eaters will not change them, it will only make them double down on their behaviour. Just be the best person you can be and hope to inspire and motivate those around you. Change is gradual and ebbs and flows. || Statistics show that vegetarian and vegan diets are on the rise. Europeans that follow a vegan diet have doubled in the last 5 years ( source: vegansociety)

And as for vegan restaurants, it's only natural, there is a market opportunity, there is an absurd increase of businesses to fill that gap, and in the end, too many went for the opportunity, but there isn't that much demand (yet). Definitely there are many more vegan options than 10-20 years ago.

And we will always have tofu and beans. || You should get into vegan activism so you can actually have an impact on this issue. || I know this isn‚Äôt it but please try chunk foods steak https://www.chunkfoods.com. This should hopefully get you excited as to where things are headed next. I expect vegan cheese also to finally turn the corner as vegan casein protein is likely to start showing up meaning you could very quickly see it in pizza restaurants:) || What location is this in reference to? Sure, Vegan restaurants come and go, but in Europe it's thriving, the supermarkets and all. || I have been a vegan for 43 years and will never change. I think of the animals and the suffering they go through and could never be the cause of that. 

Part of the changes you see are because of a rise of vegan food during covid and once people were out and about again they went more back to their common habits. Unfortunate but a lot of the drive of newer products and restaurants were towards flexitarians who wanted to improve their diet and help the environment and animals. Some found some of it lacking and costs escalated when inflation hit so bad last year and the year before. The market probably was too glutted with all sorts of things coming out. So it is settling down, but some will and have always dissed vegan foods and hence the change to plant based titles. The vegan market segment needs to be more refined with better tasting, healthier foods to attract and keep the flexitarians out there. Don't hide, don't feel bad, just help people learn it tastes good and is healthier for you! || Never give up on the animals. Either you are for them or you‚Äôre not. It may seem like it‚Äôs not cool to be vegan anymore but I didn‚Äôt do it to be cool or liked. I could never stop being vegan no matter what bc I know I save animals every day. And if you didn‚Äôt do it for the animals then do it for all of us who need ppl to stay vegan and never give up. || 11 Madison Park will still have a full vegan menu, the change won‚Äôt be for months.

A lot of animal leather is actually coated in plastic,"I'd heard about this before, and wondered if it was an overstatement since animal leather is portrayed as natural, biodegradable, and superior to vegan leather. Then I stumbled upon [this great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-UGgf7i0qM) by TofuDog on YouTube. I'm so shocked by how common it is to coat leather in plastic, and yet so many don't know about it. I did my own research and even non-vegan websites/stores admit it (pigmented leather) is coated in plastic/polymer ‚Äì see [here](https://www.leffler.com.au/shop/leather/upholstery/futura-leathers/pigmented-leather/) and [here](https://urbanrhythm.com.au/pages/about-leather).

I'm sure many already know this, but if you don't, it's useful to know as many argue vegan leather is 'just plastic'. My response to that has always been that synthetic leather is still less than half as damaging as cow leather cradle to gate (see [this report](https://www.greylockglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Pulse-of-the-Fashion-Industry_2017.pdf) page 42). Now I'll definitely bring up plastic/pigmented leather. And of course the main argument is animals are not clothing or products, and if you wouldn't use dog or cat skin, why use the skin of other animals.

Hopefully others find this interesting and useful! I'd love to learn more about this topic if anyone else has more info to share :)


**SUMMARY:** If you don't have time to watch the video, in a nutshell there are 3 general types of leather ‚Äì pigmented (coated in polymer/plastic), semi-aniline (less coating), and aniline (no coating). The coating protects from UV, water damage, scratches, and allows you to cover any scars/skin imperfections. Therefore aniline (uncoated) is much more expensive and less durable. Much of the animal leather sold today is pigmented for these reasons. Before I was vegan, I'm sure I only ever used pigmented leather since it was always fairly waterproof, and most of what I see others use is very likely the same.","Yes thank you for mentioning this. I also know most leather is kinda a fusion of plastic anyway. Very rarely is something full leather only. The most important reason to not buy leather is of course the beautiful animals that are robbed of life to be turned into shoes and such. || Yeah, leather is seen as a green material, environmentally positive, etc. but the production of it is very harmful and toxic and the end product isn't especially ""natural"" at all. || Very good to know!

Any tips on how I can go fully vegan at 15?,"I wanted to go vegan since last year because I was so devastated by the changes in the planet and I wanted to eat less meat because I don‚Äôt wanna contribute to this and I also care about the animals and it‚Äôs heartbreaking to see videos of the slaughterhouse I really want to go vegan and i feel like I‚Äôm serious about it now I stopped eating chicken, sea food and meat but I still eat  eggs occasionally sometimes diary stuff and I wanna change that but I don‚Äôt know how to do it without my family coming at me and telling me and telling me this is stupid so what can I do? How should I start? I‚Äôm sorry if this post has typos but I‚Äôm writing this in a hurry ","I went vegan at 16 years old. Mom said fine, as long as I made the food myself. Stubborn me said, sure I will!

This was in the mid 90's. Pretty much no meat substitutes and ""luxuries"" of today. I went to the library and borrowed a few cook books. Bought veggies, dried beans and lentils and learned from scratch.

In hindsight I'm glad I did it this way. It taught me a lot.

Nowadays, use the internet, don't worry about doomsday prophets and stay strong! You're on the right side of history! || One thing to remember Be sure to eat enough calories and plenty of whole, nutrient rich carbohydrates. Never restrict fruit or things like sweet potatoes, for example, out of an irrational fear of carbs. Your body and brain need glucose to function.


doing this will give you plenty of sustainable energy to your body and brain, and in my experience, is the foundation of a sustainable vegan diet. || So sick of reading posts like this by young people who are in such unsupportive environments. Sorry about that, love. My 50-year-old self thinks ‚Äútell them to go fuck themselves‚Äù and live your better life, insisting they accommodate. That‚Äôs not always practical, I understand. The best you can do is gauge the situation and your family‚Äôs attitudes and do your best to explain why this is important to you. If they think it‚Äôs just a silly stupid phase, fine. Show them where your moral compass points. || i went vegetarian at 14, vegan at 17. first of all i want to say it‚Äôs a great idea to take this step, the environment and the animals will thank you. i won‚Äôt lie and say that being vegan is easy, maybe after a few years but in the beginning it‚Äôs quite hard. you can‚Äôt buy your usual foods, you can‚Äôt eat at the same restaurants, can‚Äôt eat the same school lunch, can‚Äôt cook the same recipes, you have to bring your own food to family gatherings ‚Ä¶ but after a while you get used to it, and now being vegan is the thing i love the most about myself. my parents thought i was dumb and childish for wanting to go vegetarian at 14, they thought it was a phase. but eventually even my trump loving dad came around to it. he even started cooking meals for me, and buying vegetarian alternatives. they understood it wasn‚Äôt a phase. at 17 when i went vegan my parents once again thought it was a phase, and that it was a stupid decision. but they quickly realised i was serious about it and that i was old enough to make my own decisions. i cook my own food now and ive found some great recipes, i can‚Äôt imagine ever eating dairy or eggs again! your parents will come around to it. cook your own food, find your own recipes. and take it slowly, and keep track of your nutrients! you‚Äôll do great and i wish you all the luck || I‚Äôm proud of you for wanting to make a positive change. Remember that there are millions of people in the world that feel the way you do. I would suggest playing with some recipes that are easy to make vegan: tofu stir fry, curried lentils, quinoa and black bean bowls, etc.  If your family sees you eating really yummy, healthy stuff, they are more likely to be curious instead of having a reflex rejection response. If you are looking for an egg substitute, I absolutely love Just Egg. I make a veggie frittata with it every week and eat for breakfast. || Remember: veganism is about reducing as much as you can. Being under your parents, you may not be able to cut out meat or dairy completely. But you can make changes. Switch to oat milk with cereal, eat porridge. For lunch pack your own vegan foods, like hummus wraps or buy veggie burgers if your school has it. For dinner you might be out of luck, but maybe if it‚Äôs easy you could suggest something like Meatless Mondays to your parents, and offer to cook or help.
Small changes can go a long way, even if you can‚Äôt fully commit to veganism, you can still stand for veganism and push the movement ‚ù§Ô∏è || It depends on what your family is like, and I highly recommend you give it some good thought before even mentioning the word ‚Äòvegan‚Äô around them.¬†

Are they open minded to different views, do they care about animals, are they confrontational or stubborn, have they ever shown dislike of vegans before?¬†If they‚Äôre open minded and/or care about animals, I highly recommend watching a documentary with them.¬†My whole family went vegan because one family member got us all to watch Dominion, and I doubt we‚Äôd have changed so easily if we didn‚Äôt see what happens. Dominion 2018 is on YouTube and there‚Äôs also Earthlings. You could try What the Health or Forks Over Knives (both on YouTube) if your family still believe plant based diets are unhealthy after Dominion/Earthlings. Act as though you aren‚Äôt already vegan at heart and are just curious, and you‚Äôve heard people saying it‚Äôs a life changing documentary and you want to watch it with them.

I think if you tried this approach (if your family care about animals and are open minded), it would be far easier as the docs do all the talking for you. They would probably support you going vegan and may even join you, making it so much easier. Good luck and thanks for wanting to help animals! || I also went vegan at 15 with very unsupportive parents and my 10 year vegan anniversary was just a few days ago! 

I would just try to eat enough food and variety of grains/lentils/fruits/vegetables/etc. and that should cover your nutritional bases. There are also a lot of great cookbooks and recipes online that might be helpful. One of my favorites is the College Vegan cookbook which has super simple and cheap recipes.

Having an unsupportive family is very difficult so I wouldn‚Äôt be too harsh on yourself if you can‚Äôt be 100% vegan at the start. You have your whole life ahead to make a difference and even cutting out some things is better than nothing || When i was in 6th grade i decided i didnt want to consume certain animal products, it wasnt a matter of maybe, it was an absolute and firm NO i would not ever have it, parents knew that and provided me with things i would consume

Parents were pretty terrible, physically and emotionally abusive, i got stitches from their beatings, they would burn me, etc; but they wouldnt let me starve and i doubt most parents wouldnt either

If you remain firm chances are they would change, but if you falter and consume animal products that tells your parents you arent serious, so skipping a few meals wont kill you but it will kill animals, also i imagine there are plant based snacks around so its not as if you would actually starve

Best option is to explain to parents that you dont want to consume animal products, and that you are willing to go grocery shopping with them so you can pick appropriate items, if you can learn how to cook that would be great as well, less work for them would make them more willing to oblige, also it is important that you do grocery shop with them because there are a lot of PLANT BASED products that arent vegan and they have fooled a lot of us vegans therefore it would most definitely fool a non vegan and then the non vegan feels bad they bought you some misleading animal based product

For cooking this could help https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/17ykjz7/cooking_as_a_disabled_vegan_how_i_found_solutions/

I feel that we have a lot more power than we think, its just that most of us quit, im not a quitter, im 38 and have never used drugs, alcohol or cigs and i have been celibate for a decade, being stubborn and sticking to my decisions has always been a quality i possessed, i feel that if vegan kids remain strong and consistently refuse, the parents would realize its a serious situation, but in most cases its just a waiting game, waiting for the child to fail or give in

I share this pretyped message sometimes, perhaps it applies || If you live with your parents, first you would have to convince them or at least, have them understand why it's important for you. Explain what changes would be necessary for them to accommodate your new lifestyle and how they could help. Expect difficulties and mistakes, especially at the beginning and go at your own pace.

Most important: Learn to cook.

Good luck! || Your best bet is trying to get your parents to better understand you, so they can support you in the way a parent should.. Especially one who recognize that their child is promoting peace and better tomorrow -  something they should be proud of. || At 15 you need your parents support to do this completely (most likely).  If they are receptive, to you making these changes, great!  (If they aren‚Äôt, dont worry but adjust your expectations for now- remember being vegan is about the least harm not zero harm)

If they are at least accepting ask to go to the grocery store and handle the legwork of looking for the vegan option on the shelf. Getting them to change a brand here and there may be easy. 

You will want to learn to cook and how to encourage your parents on how to cook in a way that works for you. For example ‚Äúpasta night‚Äù may be avoiding egg noodles and getting a vegan sauce at the store. Get them to top with cheese etc after cooking. Maybe you add a vegan protein to your plate while they put dead stuff on theirs etc. || I think this is a noble cause. You‚Äôll need supportive parents first off otherwise you might want to just go vegetarian in the beginning because vegan requires real support from those you live and cook with. Best of luck üòÄüòç || Dr. Gregor ‚ÄòHow Not to Die‚Äô video shows that plant based eating is the healthiest way to eat. Maybe you can watch it together? It‚Äôs free on YouTube || if your parents are willing to pay for it. || Smart move.  Not rocket science.  Take a vegan multivitamin || Trust me you don't wanna grow malnourished || First of all, kudos to you for wanting to make a difference and understanding at your age the difference that veganism can make. Don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself as you get started - focus on what‚Äôs practical and possible for you in your current situation. 

Your parents might be receptive to you offering to cook some meals - I know I loved it when my teenagers took over some cooking - and if you learn some basics you can start making vegan dinners for the family. Like one other poster said, focusing the conversation on ‚Äúhealthy eating‚Äù rather than ethics might be easier with your parents if you think they‚Äôre not going to be receptive to the concept of veganism.

Look for simple recipes - there are many online if you search ‚Äúvegan recipe‚Äù - and make sure you‚Äôre getting enough calories. Things like curries and soups are very easy to veganize, and you can make big batches so that you have leftovers for lunches, etc. 

You can also start adding really simple and nutritious things like hummus, whole grain bread, nuts and seeds to your meals. Vegan food is more about diversity of protein sources in your meals and less about ‚Äúthis chunk in the centre of my plate is my protein‚Äù. Think about including different protein sources in each meal. For example, you could have a bowl with quinoa, tofu, pumpkin seeds, veggies, and a tahini dressing cashew cream (easy to make if you have a blender!) or make tacos with refried beens and soyrizo (easy to make - search for recipes). 

If cooking for your family is not practical right now, you could take a ‚Äúvegan before 6 pm‚Äù approach. Make your own vegan lunch and breakfast, and then join your family in their omnivore dinner. It‚Äôs a compromise, but would be better than feeling like veganism is impossible right now. 

Best of luck to you on your journey! || Start by not buying any animal products or products tested on animals.

I‚Äôm struggling with veganism due to be intolerant to soy,"Has anyone here eaten out a soy intolerance?



Ideally I‚Äôd be vegan. As a diet it meets my values best.





But I can‚Äôt eat soy without either shitting myself (eating/drinking a lot of soy based products) or being incredibly bloated and horrible feeling (small amounts of soy)


It‚Äôs only really an issue when I‚Äôm eating out (which means I‚Äôm technically a pescatarian- sorry, I‚Äôd love to be vegan but often the veggie options are even inedible to me when out!)



So yeah, can I just train my body? I‚Äôve heard lactose intolerant people have.




Edit: didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd need to add that I know it‚Äôs incredibly easy to eat vegan without soy when I‚Äôm cooking for myself but it was eating out that the issue was with- which is not always possible to avoid.



Thank you to everyone who tried to help but please don‚Äôt recommend seitan as a soy alternative because a lot of the commercial seitan available has soy in it. 


","Seitan is your friend. Also there are many choices of vegan yogurt and milk that are not from soy. Plus, you can make your own tofu from different lentils || Live Kindly has some tips for being a soy free vegan [https://www.livekindly.com/ultimate-vegan-diet-guide-allergies/#:\~:text=%7C%20Katerina/Unsplash-,How%20to%20eat%20vegan%20when%20you're%20allergic%20to%20soy,pumpkin%20seeds%20and%20from%20chickpeas](https://www.livekindly.com/ultimate-vegan-diet-guide-allergies/#:~:text=%7C%20Katerina/Unsplash-,How%20to%20eat%20vegan%20when%20you're%20allergic%20to%20soy,pumpkin%20seeds%20and%20from%20chickpeas)

You don't have to have soy based products. || Not to split hairs, but Veganism isn't a diet. It's a moral philosophy. If you're not trying to join a moral philosophy, I would stick with the term ""plant-based."" Good luck! || I don't even eat soy once a month. There are hundreds of other options, even when eating out.

PS. You might want to watch some videos about the horrors of the fishing industry. It's even sadder IMO than terrestrial animal ag. || Try Seitan and beans for protein

tough love but if you REALLY want to be vegan you would know that a few minutes of taste pleasure eating out isn't worth a fish - who feels pain - suffering and dying || What soy products have you tried? Were there other ingredients you could have issues with? Maybe an elimination diet? If you can eat wheat gluten then I'm jealous of you! I developed a gluten intolerance after being vegan and and COVID. Soy is my friend so we may be the inverse of each other lol can you have other beans? Pair it with some rice and it's a complete protein. There is also quinoa which is complete as well. Also, lentils are a soy alternative. You would have to be careful eating out of course and ask about ingredients.

I also was pescatarian before being vegan, fishing is very destructive to the ocean and farmed fish is horrible. And with fish farms or in the ocean, there is loss of life to other animals in the process. || I have a thyroid condition(hashimotos) so I‚Äôm not really supposed to be eating soy. I consume very low amounts of it, it‚Äôs possible just more annoying. No need to eat fish- greens, and legumes exist. A lot of things are made with mycelium now too || If you‚Äôre going to try to train your body not to be intolerant of soy you should consult a doctor specialising in allergies first. If it turns out to be an allergy they‚Äôre not to be messed around with, they can get worse unexpectedly and put you in danger. But I recommend legumes, seitan and pea protein powder if you need a lot of protein. For milks I find oat milk is the best for drinks as a sub for soy milk. Then as well if you want to stop eating fish, maybe get a supplement with vegan omega 3. I have a powder of ground flax seed and other stuff that I put on my morning oats. 

For eating out, I do get it because tofu is a big go-to for places that do vegan options. Some places have started doing seitan where I am but yeah it‚Äôs not the majority at all. I might suggest Indian food if you like it? Dahl often doesn‚Äôt have dairy in it. My fav places are always exclusively vegan cafes though. Because then you can have anything you want, it‚Äôll taste good and actually have nutrition (I was at a non-vegan restaurant once that gave me a cauliflower steak that I kid you not was a slab of barely cooked, unseasoned cauliflower). Apart from that it‚Äôs unfortunately something you just have to sacrifice. On the bright side, eating plant-based when out does mean you end up supporting local independent places way more often than not, because those are usually the ones doing the best food. || Do you have an intolerance or an allergy? I would not mess with allergies. Taking care of yourself and nourishing your body comes first, veganism second. You can probably do it though - use oat or almond milk instead, and avoid soy based tofu and tempeh. Heavy on the beans, quinoa, etc. Soy lecithin is in just about every processed food it seems. || Live Kindly has some tips on being a soy free vegan -- [https://www.livekindly.com/ultimate-vegan-diet-guide-allergies/#:\~:text=%7C%20Katerina/Unsplash-,How%20to%20eat%20vegan%20when%20you're%20allergic%20to%20soy,pumpkin%20seeds%20and%20from%20chickpeas](https://www.livekindly.com/ultimate-vegan-diet-guide-allergies/#:~:text=%7C%20Katerina/Unsplash-,How%20to%20eat%20vegan%20when%20you're%20allergic%20to%20soy,pumpkin%20seeds%20and%20from%20chickpeas) .

Check out the book Fiber Fueled, there are also videos on the subject. You eat as little that you can tolerate, this is called microdosing, and you gradually increase the amount day by day until your gut microbiome adapts and you have no issues with it anymore. || Don¬¥t have any tips for eating out, unless you can ask them to omit soy products in something like a stir fry or something. Maybe you can ask for a salad then etc. 

Otherwise, seitan, beans and legumes are your best bet. You can also make tofu from lentils and it¬¥s not super complicated. Lots of yoghurts/cheeses are oat or coconut based, so that should be easy. 

Don¬¥t get discouraged by the vegan supremacists shitting on you, you are doing good :) 

Remember the enemy of good is perfectionism. || Yeah it's too bad soy is the only source of protein vegans can have.  I guess it's just impossible for you to be vegan. || Rice and potatoes with any veggies and your favorite sauce! || I am also intolerant to soy. It is hard because I love asian food, but they almost every time include soy. There are alternatives and you can make tofu out of lentils for examples (never tried it tho).

It is possible, it is just hard. When i go out, avoiding soy is really hard so sometimes I deal with it. || I know a lot of vegans that don't eat soy. || I was a soy free vegan for almost 15 years (pregnancy cured my intolerance, bizarrely).

Any former carnivores who are now vegans?,"I'm sure most of us here are aware of the bizarre and frankly disturbing 'carnivore' diet (which seems to exist mostly as an attempt to spite vegans and for insecure men to 'prove' their masculinity). I'm interested in knowing if there is anyone here who was once carnivore and has since become vegan? If so:

1. Why did you pursue the carnivore diet?
2. What made you switch to veganism?","Me.

I was a teenager back then, I couldn't understand scientific evidence and was just impressed by the buff carnivore dudes, and the fact that I was going against the mainstream doctors advice was appealing to me.

I read a bunch of keto books, even if I couldn't understand it fully. They were mostly full of useless mechanistic data (as they don't have health outcome data to back them up) as it seemed complex, I thought they must be right. I became so brainwashed with keto.

I tried the keto carnivore diet for 3 weeks. I ended up in a hospital because of severe vomiting. They had to hook me to an IV and put glucose straight into my blood. Doctors told me it was because of my diet, and after 48 hours when I was able to eat again, I craved rice and potatoes. Still, I was so brainwashed, that after a week of the incident I was on a low-carb diet again, eating mostly red meat and beef/pork fat.

I tried keto again a few months after that. I was eating meat and fat until I was thanksgiving full. After 3 months on the diet, I lost weight, lost most of my muscle, looked anorexic and could barely do any sport. I went back to a low carb diet and felt better. 

During the next 2-3 years, I slowly creeped back to a normal diet, the brainwashing of the keto diet slowly went away. I upped the carbs, added back grains, added fruits and vegetables, then legumes... I understood I just fell into internet propaganda. Currently im 21yo and a vegan, and oh boy, the difference is DAY and NIGHT. On a carnivore diet (or mostly carnivore) my face was bloated, my skin was tomato red, my hair was thin, I weighted 10-12kg less, I was extremely weak and the most notorious thing was my cognitive performance, I couldn't concentrate, my brain was just slow.

Currently on a vegan diet I pack more weight yet I look leaner, have way more muscle, higher energy all the time, skin looks good, brain is working well...

I regret being a carnivore, because of the damage I did to the animals, and the damage I did to my own health. How restrictive the diet was, how many bad times and health issues I had because of the diet...

But at the same time I'm glad that phase is over, and that I'm currently healthy and thriving on a vegan diet. || Not necessarily ‚Äúcarnivore,‚Äù but I went straight from strict ‚Äúketo‚Äù to vegan almost twenty years ago. I was and still am an avid weightlifter. Keto was a huge fad at the time with insanely high protein intake. My last meal before purely plants was meat, eggs and cheese only. || The carnivore diet is a conspiracy by Big Beef and Dairy to boost sales after losing a sizable share of the market to plant based alternatives in the last decade. They are paying social media influencers to promote pseudoscience and toxic masculinity to encourage people to only eat meat and dairy. It‚Äôs so blatantly obvious! And yet these carnivore influencers claim that veganism is a conspiracy by Big Pharma to make people sick and rely on pharmaceutical drugs! It‚Äôs insanity. || Health reasons, more energy and cardiovascular health increased. Less cloudy plasma || In my early 20s a meat based keto diet appealed to me because hey, media portrayals of cavemen eat lots of meat and cavemen are cool. Even though it‚Äôd be another 5 years before going vegan I felt slightly bad about the extra suffering and stopped cosplaying || Self proclaimed carnivore before going vegan almost cold veggie;

It wasn‚Äôt as hard as I thought it would be. I did it because I could not be an accessory to the cruelty and vile behavior of industrial animal farming and for me, I‚Äôm not willing to take a living creature‚Äôs life just to eat something I thought used to taste good. These days with a thing called the internet, truly creative people share vegan dishes that fulfill those kinds of cravings in ‚Äúfoodies‚Äù. 

We share this planet with nature. It‚Äôs past time we acknowledge this and act accordingly. || Not carnivore, but I went keto for a while to see if it would help with some mental health issues (did the whole nine yards with the food scale and the blood ketosis meter). It didn't work for me, but I do believe that ketosis can have health benefits for many conditions (and a diet low in refined sugar is good for everyone). I liked how I felt satiated, had very few cravings, and generally felt in control of my disordered eating, but I haven't tried vegan keto because the diet is so limited (and I don't feel like I got enough benefit from keto to be worth it). I know some people are on vegan keto, though, and I think that's great.

Went vegan for ethical reasons. I just stopped being able to justify eating animal products. || I was a carnivore for a very short time. Made me feel like shit. Went vegitarian for unrelated reasons (climate change), eventually became vegan for the animals. || No. Humans are omnivores, none of us are carnivores no matter how much some people want to be. Humans trying to survive solely on raw meat without eating anything else don't last all that long || Yup || I was a vegan with gut issues that ultimately worsened to the point that I couldn't tolerate any fiber or carbohydrates. So, in order to survive, I ate only meat for about a year and a meat-based ketogenic diet for a few years. I'm now basically back to a healthy plant-based diet with proper medication for my immune system.

I think, most of the time, when people report benefits from carnivore, it's really just about dropping all the processed crap and eliminating food that they are allergic or sensitive to (without going through the effort of correctly identifying problem foods). It's disgusting, and I don't really think it's a healing diet in any way. It can sometimes be a helpful temporary baseline/elimination diet for certain problems- and that can be a valuable, healing break from triggers. But people trying to do this or any ketogenic diet, long-term/permanently, are insane IMHO (and it won't end well for them).

WFPB is the real, sustainable, and healing diet. People tend to get excited and think it will cure everything. The reality is that it is very demanding on the gut and just doesn't work, or even backfires, for certain kinds of gut issues. || I was a full carnivore. I did it because I wanted to lose weight for a jiu jitsu tournament and someone said 0 carb is best way to go. I researched found the carnivore rabbit hole and decided to do that while cutting. I ended up not losing any weight, jsut body fat. I got way better at going hard at jiu jitsu, my ability to eat lots of meat grew (slaking 30-40 chicken wings with 0 bloat), and I didn‚Äôt seem to lose muscle or weight just burned fat slowly. I ended up looking absurd, very muscular and lean. My lifts were close to where they were but I didn‚Äôt prioritize calories or powerlifting (was working / jiu jitsu). Energy levels were different, it was like stable steady state, wasn‚Äôt tired, did even better at cardio but I could not explode the same, couldn‚Äôt run as fast. 

The energy levels you get on keto made me perform better at work. I suspect it‚Äôs also some sort of dopamine detox. All I ate was groundbeef, or ribeye. Only dopamine I could count on throught the day was work or jiu jitsu related and after so many days ur body and mind realize this

"Please debate me, i want to make a concious choice","Ive done the math. I want to buy  durable shoes. The most durable option is a leather pair.
I know i will get shit for it, especially at a vegan heavy place i frequent.
But in the long run, buying 1 pair of leather shoes, which may very well last me 10+ years, is **way** more eco friendly than buying 40 pair of shoes in the same span. Also, money wise, way cheaper.

Debate me, (pls)","Leather shoes were made of the skin of someone. Not of something.

Don't be cruel. || Does your morality about cruelty not trump being ‚Äòeco friendly‚Äô about the environment? || Just buy 2nd hand at the very least if you are that desperate for someone's else's skin on your feet and so confident that durability isn't to be found in vegan shoes. || You‚Äôre over thinking. Not only is about not actively contributing to animal harm it‚Äôs also about normalizing it.¬†

If you decide to wear the skin of someone else on your feet, you send the message that is acceptable. Choose another fabric. If you‚Äôre worried about your contribution, choose a pre owned top quality rubber shoe.¬† || Not to be nasty, as a thought experiment:

How would you explain your choice to the cow who will be killed for that leather? || Leather is not environmentally friendly though. 

It's not a by-product of the beef industry but a co-product of it : buying leather directly supports the beef industry, which is extremely polluting.
Leather is chemically treated so it doesn't biodegrade as dead skin would. It's basically plastic.

I also want to point out that shoes are so important for our bodies, especially our feet, knees and back. You will have to change them when they are too damaged anyway, so I would suggest looking for plant-based barefoot shoes. I bought some from a little brand named T√©lito, they are made of hemp, cotton and natural recycled rubber. || I bought vegan winter shoes for Canadian crazy weather and still kicking. -40 ! We don‚Äôt wear someone else skin. As simple as that || Leather is not environmentally friendly. It uses a ton of toxic chemicals to process, and requires a lot of land to raise the animals to slaughter age. || You may have an argument if you are considering environmental impact (I have no idea how accurate your 10x figure is but let‚Äôs go with it).¬†

Veganism is about being anti-exploitation of animals so the other shoes‚Äô environmental impact is irrelevant.

So it depends on whether you‚Äôre doing it for environmental reasons or animal rights || I recommend r/DebateAVegan || If the most durable shoes could be made out of you, would you find that acceptable? || Would buying human leather shoes be ethical if they were more eco friendly? If not, why is it ethical for cow leather?

You present only two options: leather eco friendly or synthetic non-eco friendly, but are those options really the only two?

Are you factoring in the greenhouse gas emissions from cows? Or just longevity of materials?

Have you really exhausted synthetic materials for shoes? Or does it just *feel* like cow skin are the only available durable option?

What if you buy cow skin shoes and they don‚Äôt work out? Or they get ruined? Or you stop needing them? Or you die? Your whole basis of them being better is on an unknown *chance* that you will use them for a long time.

But most basically, animals are not products. You shouldn‚Äôt treat them as products. || By your logic I'll just go barefoot since that's the most eco friendly and not to mention, cheaper. || I've recently-ish bought footwear made primarily of rubber, and of lyocell. Are these that non eco friendly? Also looking into trying out traditional jute. Surely you don't think raising cattle is more eco friendly than those options, even without considering individual suffering? || Where are you finding shoes that only last for 3 months? I've bought walking boots, canvas shoes and boots, and sandals, all lasted for 5+ years. 

Leather isn't an eco option. It's made with pretty nasty preservatives and dyes. Then there's the cruelty of course. Longevity shouldn't be the only measure, factor all the other ethics into it. || The decision of veganism is primarily a moral one. If you can only make decisions that benefit you the most personally. Then I really have nothing to say to you. || Just buy second hand shoes and keep them in good condition. You can easily get shoes at garage sales for a few dollars. At the end of the day this is your decision and you will be the one that has to live with your own actions. || In the long run it‚Äôs better to choose vegan shoes. Why? Because in ideal world nobody kills animals. Lifestock farming is bad for the environment so when you‚Äôre choosing leather shoes you‚Äôre supporting lifestock farming (that is environmentally bad decision). Right *now* maybe leather shoes is better for environment IF you look only at those shoes and not to the everything else too but it‚Äôs not a good decision in the long run and in the big picture. Also - people will create some sustainable plant based material when there‚Äôs need. If you keep supporting leather footwear then there‚Äôs no need to think about making other materials. || Just buy used. It‚Äôs that simple. || My vegan boots lasted 5 years. Why do yours last only 3 months?",0,vegan,2025-08-12 02:41:36,please debate want make concious choice,ive done math want buy durable shoes durable option leather pair know get shit especially vegan heavy place frequent long run buying pair leather shoes may well last years way eco friendly buying pair shoes span also money wise way cheaper debate pls,leather shoes made skin someone something cruel morality cruelty trump eco friendly environment buy nd hand least desperate someone else skin feet confident durability found vegan shoes thinking actively contributing animal harm also normalizing decide wear skin someone else feet send message acceptable choose another fabric worried contribution choose pre owned top quality rubber shoe nasty thought experiment would explain choice cow killed leather leather environmentally friendly though product beef industry co product buying leather directly supports beef industry extremely polluting leather chemically treated biodegrade dead skin would basically plastic also want point shoes important bodies especially feet knees back change damaged anyway would suggest looking plant based barefoot shoes bought little brand named lito made hemp cotton natural recycled rubber bought vegan winter shoes canadian crazy weather still kicking wear someone else skin simple leather environmentally friendly uses ton toxic chemicals process requires lot land raise animals slaughter age may argument considering environmental impact idea accurate x figure let go veganism anti exploitation animals shoes environmental impact irrelevant depends whether environmental reasons animal rights recommend r debateavegan durable shoes could made would find acceptable would buying human leather shoes ethical eco friendly ethical cow leather present two options leather eco friendly synthetic non eco friendly options really two factoring greenhouse gas emissions cows longevity materials really exhausted synthetic materials shoes feel like cow skin available durable option buy cow skin shoes work get ruined stop needing die whole basis better unknown chance use long time basically animals products treat products logic go barefoot since eco friendly mention cheaper recently ish bought footwear made primarily rubber lyocell non eco friendly also looking trying traditional jute surely think raising cattle eco friendly options even without considering individual suffering finding shoes last months bought walking boots canvas shoes boots sandals lasted years leather eco option made pretty nasty preservatives dyes cruelty course longevity measure factor ethics decision veganism primarily moral one make decisions benefit personally really nothing say buy second hand shoes keep good condition easily get shoes garage sales dollars end day decision one live actions long run better choose vegan shoes ideal world nobody kills animals lifestock farming bad environment choosing leather shoes supporting lifestock farming environmentally bad decision right maybe leather shoes better environment look shoes everything else good decision long run big picture also people create sustainable plant based material need keep supporting leather footwear need think making materials buy used simple vegan boots lasted years last months
Best coffee makers 2025: which one should I buy?,"Hi all  
I‚Äôm planning to buy a my coffee maker and want to hear from people who‚Äôve tried the latest machines. What do you think are the best coffee makers in 2025? I‚Äôm open to drip, espresso, or pod machines, just looking for something reliable, easy to use, and that makes great coffee. Any recommendations or experiences would be super helpful!  
Thanks","Technivorm Moccamaster! || def dont get a keurig I work in a very large office complex with many smaller offices and I am constantly seeing them in the trash || Definitely the Technivorm Moccamaster, it‚Äôs a BIFL favorite || Moka pot || Just use a French press. They will literally last many lifetimes and they make way better tasting coffee than any other method. It's a no brainer. || The most reliable option will be a non electronic device. Say a Chemex or a V60. You‚Äôll need to buy papers, but that‚Äôs about it. Then there are options like the Aeropress which are similarly wonderful.

When it comes to an espresso machine or a pod machine, they‚Äôre not BIFL as they all break over time, it‚Äôs inevitable. I would say espresso machines are generally more recyclable and better for the planet than pod machines, but they‚Äôre expensive and need either repair or replacement eventually. 

Personally I‚Äôd buy a Chemex & V60 (for multiple cups and single cups) and if I wanted to splurge, a nice grinder. If you insist on an electric machine, the Sage/Breville have a lifespan of 5 years, Jura 2 years and most other things somewhere in between. || French press. Easily my favorite way to drink coffee. We have an espresso machine but it rarely gets used over the French press || Drip is the most reliable. The Bonavita 8 cup or something similar with SCA certification and a thermal carafe is what I'd go with. The Breville one is very nice as well. 

At the end of the day, a good grinder is more important than a good coffee maker. And having both is even better. The budget friendly grinder I'd go with is one of the Breville burr grinders. DF54 is the next one up I'd consider. || Zojirushi! It's like a Bonavita but it has a timer which is essential for me in the morning. Carafe is thermal and stays hot forever, great tasting coffee and I have had it for years || The Moccamaster, there is no substitute. || A Bialetti Moka pot every time - true bifl, just change the perpetually available gasket every decade or so.

"Durable, breathable and sustainable underwear ‚Äî found a winner (Update)","
Hey guys,

A couple months back I asked about finding underwear that was ethical, affordable, and actually durable. After a lot of dead ends, I ended up trying out Moku bamboo underwear. Saw their name on a random sticker, took a chance, and honestly I‚Äôm glad I did.

I‚Äôve been wearing them daily for about three months now, which means each pair has gone through around 20-26 wash cycles, and they still look and feel brand new. I train MMA so most underwear I‚Äôve owned either stretches out, loses shape, or just ar2nt breathable enough. These haven‚Äôt flinched.

I only started with three pairs but I‚Äôm definitely going to grab more. If you‚Äôre after comfortable, long-lasting underwear that doesn‚Äôt fall apart after a few washes, these are absolutely worth checking out.

Thank you and most likely farewell.,"Around 10 years ago now, one of my wallets was posted to this subreddit for a review, and overnight my job was born. Thanks to this subreddit I've been very fortunate to build a life with my wife and now child here in Australia as a leatherworker. 

Recently, a new US tariff policy announcement was made. The scrapping of the $800 De Minimis exemption which then forces all goods entering the US to incur a tariff. This tariff is to be paid prior to shipping. Obviously I would have to incorporate that tariff into the price of my wallets. With that decision, Australia Post have had to suspend most forms of postal service to the US. This includes shipping of my wallets to US Customers. Most of my customer base in based in the US. 90% or so. Also, as Australia has a 10% tariff rate, the decision also states that any country with a tariff rate under 16% should have to pay $80USD per item entering the US. Incorporating that extra cost, as well as the extra cost of shipping, immediately more than doubles the price of wallets, which is unsustainable. With the flick of a pen, the business which was born here on this subreddit is more than likely over. 

  
I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who has ordered a wallet over the years. I hope they serve you well for years to come. I hope a solution is found where I can continue to do business as usual, but the forecast is grim. 

  
Thank you again.

Can‚Äôt wait for it to come in the mail ! || I'm in Oz - browsing your website now. 

Also you know how else loves quality goods not from the USA? Canadians - I'll share in groups there as well. || Thank you so much for the comments of support and help with ideas for work arounds and solutions. I'll respond to all of you as soon as I can.

**EDIT 26th August at 8:10pm AEST**: Hi everyone. Today I've been solo parenting to a 3 year old as my wife has been at work, so I've found it difficult to respond to everyone in a prompt manner. I'm working through as diligently as I can. Thank you so much for your patience.

I am absolutely floored by the response everyone here has shown. It has been extremely overwhelming and I am full of gratitude. I cannot begin to sum up in words the support everyone has shown today. Thank you all so much! I've recorded a short video to update folks who have placed an order today, I'll leave that [video here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpN-HaU7dRY) In the video I thanked folks from around the world and here at home in Australia for placing an order today. It is truly staggering. I paid particular note to Canadians who have really shown their world renowned kindness. But I really want to express my most extreme and grateful thank you to all folks from every part of this planet that chipped in to help me today. I cannot believe it.

I'm going to be very busy for the next few weeks and I will work hard to ensure everyone's orders are dispatched in a timely manner.

I haven't updated my social media in a long time, but I will certainly be using it more to keep everyone in the loop. What a crazy day today has been. Thank you thank you thank you!

**EDIT 27TH AUGUST 5:05AM AEST:** Good morning everyone. Well, after an absolutely wild 24 hours, I've got a lot of work to getting on with! I woke up at about 1am and just haven't been able to get back to sleep, so I'll spend about an hour or so here responding to as many questions and comments as I can before I start fulfilling the orders I've received. Once again, thank you so much to everyone. Words feel very inadequate to explain how crazy a whiplash of emotion the last 24 hours has been. || Having done some international shipping and warehousing in the US, have you considered any 3PL in the US to handle your US orders? Shipping in bulk should get to the minimum and only have to increase prices slightly? Perhaps worth a shot? || The US is not the only country with customers who want your product. Good luck as you pivot your advertising to find customers in countries like Canada, where we still appreciate quality items and support international trade. || God dammit this sucks. I‚Äôve had one of your wallets since Christmas 2016 and it‚Äôs just as good as the day it was delivered. I‚Äôll probably have this thing for 20+ years! Hope you and your family land on your feet friend. || I sympathize. The shoe store I've been buying from in England is also closing due to the US tariffs.... 
This is unfortunately going to continue happening. || Fucking hell, I‚Äôm so sorry man.   I‚Äôm disgusted. || I'm really sorry to hear that, man. As an American it's heartbreaking to see this stuff happen. It's one thing when we crap in our own back yard, but quite another when we crap in our neighbors' yards. I hope things change, but until they do a lot of people are going to suffer. || Thanks Chris. 

And a big FU to anyone who posts comments like, leave politics out of it. Politicians have decided to stick their finger into everything else, so everything is political now. || Damn, I'm so sorry. || Sorry we have an idiot fascist pedo for a president. || I apologize on behalf of sane Americans. We are living in the literal upside down here ‚Äî and not enough people are overreacting.
 Good luck. || You need to contact a warehouse shipping place in the US and you could do bulk. That should reduce the price per wallet drastically. || I‚Äôm sorry, Chris. I didn‚Äôt vote for this fucker or his ‚Äòplatform.‚Äô And I‚Äôm a lawyer watching half the country cheer on presidential overreach and the death of due process. Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better - I‚Äôd attempt trade with other nations; you can‚Äôt count on the USA anymore. || Your wares look nice and I‚Äôm Canadian. Will you be restocking the colours that are currently sold out? || I thought that depending on shipping method, you are either paying the scarier sounding flat rates like the $80 if coming via international post (ex usps, China post) or a percentage base like 10-20% if coming via commercial carrier (ex dhl.)

In the small chance this means your business may have a shot, I‚Äôd look into it. || I usually ship to EU From the USA but have that on hold for now.

Too many electric toothbrush options‚Ä¶ how do you even pick one?,"Alright, I think it‚Äôs finally time I upgrade from a manual brush. Problem is, I‚Äôve been looking at electric toothbrushes and now I‚Äôm completely lost.

There‚Äôs Oral-B, Philips, Soocas‚Ä¶ and each one seems to have a million different models and features.¬†



Battery life, cleaning modes, head replacements‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even know what really matters anymore.



For those who‚Äôve been through this, what should I focus on when picking one? Any tips or things you wish you knew before buying? Right now I‚Äôm just staring at specs and trying not to make a terrible decision

","I had a Philips Sonicare 4100 for a while, but ended up switching to a Soocas neos ii because I want to try toothbrush and water flosser combo. Been using it for about two months now and it‚Äôs been working really well for me || Electric toothbrushes are not bifl but If I had to choose I'd go with [Sonicare 5100](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Sonicare-ProtectiveClean-Rechargeable-HX6850/dp/B078GVH2VJ/). It's not too expensive and works great. || i see this question at Reddit quite a bit

my cut and paste answer:

i'm s dentist with 42 years of experience.

Plain and simple but good quality wins the day. Oral B Pro 1000 works quite well. 

these folks agree with me:

[https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-electric-toothbrush/](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-electric-toothbrush/)

under $50 || I buy whatever is at Costco and like the Oral B ones.  I just want a freaking toothbrush and buy the lowest end models. The Oral B and Philips are on sale ever other month or so.  It's just me and I get two toothbrushes and in 10 years when the batteries have failed, I buy another pair at Costco.

PSA!!!! In addition to brushing, it's important to floss as well!  I never used to floss and my twice a year dental cleanings I was told to floss.  Then I started flossing regularly.  I didn't tell them and after the next visit, they stopped telling me to floss.  I asked why they stopped telling me and they said because they can tell if people floss.

PS.  Brushing twice a day with any toothbrush is beneficial. || I use a quip right now because my dentist said the most important thing about electric toothbrushes is regularly replacing the heads like you would replace a manual toothbrush. ¬†I like not having to think about when it is time to replace the head.¬†


Prior to that I had a sonicare that lasted 10+ years though they eventually stopped making the brush heads and I needed to buy knock off brand heads from Amazon that were compatible. ¬† || Oral B Bio. It‚Äôs easy to get replacement brushes and we got it at Costco so there were two in there not just one and a supply of brushes. I‚Äôm very happy with it and the dentist says it‚Äôs working great. || my OralB lasted for 12 years.  the battery wouldn't charge, and I failed at replacing it (I broke the tiny wires and wasn't able to repair that.)

I replaced it with another oralB, and it uses the same brush heads || I got the Oral-B they had at Costco the day I was shopping for one. 

My dentist says both Oral-B and Sonicare are good, just choose the one with the brush head you prefer. || I actively miss my Philips Sonicare when I travel. || I have both the Sonicare and the Oral-B and I prefer the latter - it seems to clean better.  I use them both though || I cannot advise on a bifl option, but spin brushes clean better than one‚Äôs that just vibrate imo. || I went for the oral b io because it‚Äôs about as feature rich as the Sonicare but its battery is easier to replace meaning it‚Äôll be easier to maintain to possibly keep for longer || Hello /u/Feisty-Jury-7011!

High quality thermal leggings,"I want some really good quality thermal leggings that can take me through winter. Previously I‚Äôve bought cheap fast fashion fleece lined tights and they bobbled and got holes after a couple of months. Now I figure I‚Äôll get some nude leggings and wear tights over them. 

Since it‚Äôs hard to buy sustainable/ethical hosiery, I want to focus on buying as little as possible instead. Does anyone have any suggestions for tights/leggings that have lasted you a long time? 

Thank you for any suggestions.  ","If you‚Äôre looking for wool, Ice Breaker base layers are very good. || Kuiu pro merino 200 bottoms. I bought these because they have zippers that go down the leg on each side which makes it easier to get out of when temps change during the day. Normally when temps change and you decide to remove or put on leggings, you have to remove your boots and pants first. The zippers on the leggings allow you to keep your shoes on, pull your outside layer pants down to your ankles, and then zip off the leggings. This is ideal for the outdoors where you don‚Äôt want your socks/bare feet to touch the ground. || I've been using a pair of Under Armour cold gear occasionally in the winter for about 10 years now and they're holding up well. I bought a couple more pairs a few years later and they're definitely thinner, but still holding up well. || I‚Äôd suggest the carhartt utility legging or pant if you want a heavier pant- they run large. But I only have one pair and don‚Äôt find myself grabbing them often. 

 The brand I swear by is Offline by Arie for day to day. I know you asked for winter leggings, im not sure if they carry lined styles; the fabric of the normal style isnt thick but it can be easily worn under jeans. The ‚ÄúHold up!‚Äù Style is thicker and when I‚Äôve gotten colored ones they seem to be thicker. 
  I cannot stress enough the comfort of this brands leggings. I‚Äôve had my first pair for about 2-3 years and the only difference is they are slightly stretched and the black has gotten dull but not red toned. I wear them close to everyday. They have a crossover designed waistline and I like this because it doesn‚Äôt put pressure on that region.

üé∂ A Cabinet for the Soundtrack of a Life,"

It started with a shared love of vinyl.

My client‚Äîan avid collector and listener‚Äîreached out with a vision: a midcentury-style cabinet that could house not just his records, but the ritual of listening itself. Honestly, I get it. There‚Äôs something timeless about dropping the needle on a record, hearing the crackle before the music begins. I‚Äôm from these days too, but that analog warmth? It never gets old.

He had a clear idea for the bottom shelf: it needed to tilt at a 15-degree angle, a subtle but intentional design choice to make browsing records feel intuitive and tactile. We talked materials, and mahogany quickly rose to the top of the list. Rich, warm, classic. After a quick budget chat, we opted for a mahogany veneer‚Äîkeeping the aesthetic intact while staying within reach.

With that, I dove into the design. A few sketches later, we had our concept. Then came the build.

As the piece began to take shape in the shop, he stopped by to check in. There‚Äôs something special about those visits‚Äîwhen the client sees the work in progress, the raw wood, the joinery, the soul of the piece still unfolding. I showed him how I planned to add a pair of brass pins to the top section to keep it secure and steady. It was a small detail, but one that added elegance and function.

Then, as we stood together looking at the nearly finished cabinet, inspiration struck. The top shelf of the lower section had a hidden cavity behind it‚Äîan unused space with potential. We tossed around ideas: drawers, small cabinets. But with records in the way, those options felt impractical. That‚Äôs when I suggested backlighting.

He lit up. ‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù he said.

And it was. A soft glow behind the records, like a quiet homage to the music itself.

This piece was more than a commission‚Äîit was a collaboration. A dialogue between craftsman and client, between form and function, nostalgia and innovation. That‚Äôs what makes the work meaningful. Not just the final product, but the shared journey to get there.

Gift wrap that doesn't immediately run out?,"I know gift wrap isn't buy it for life, but where can I buy a roll of gift wrap that isn't $6.99 for 1/2in of gift wrap? Appreciate any suggestions!

Together with the others I've collected over the years, I won't need to buy wrapping paper for the rest of my life. || Consider the Japanese way and use cute wrapping cloth. More sustainable too! Ask the receiver if they will use it like this in the future (cool if so maybe they will embrace it and pass it along too) or if they will not, you can take it back to gift give again. || Get big rolls of recycled brown paper.  Decorate with ribbons and stickers || Costco, esp end of season markdown. || Costco man. My husband bought wrapping paper years and years ago and we still use it || I get all of mine at TJMaxx, I look for the big thick rolls. || the newspaper works || You can also go the lazy route and buy cheap gift bags and tissue paper. || My Dad worked for RJ Reynolds. He  brought home red foil paper that had imperfections in it and they were going to throw it away. (Think Winston cigarettes). We used it for Christmas for 15 years. 

If you have a local similar industry that has flawed packaging?  Maybe they would sell it or give it to you? || Ikea has lovely wrapping paper designs and they are recyclable. || Our whole family has gone with [gift bags](https://www.google.com/search?q=gift+bags). Easy to use, easy to *reuse*. The ~~kids~~ *grandkids* don't tear them up because they don't need to, and they know they can reuse them in a month or a year. || I use flyers from the local record store and Sunday ads for small presents, brown paper for large.

I go to Costco, TJ Maxx/Marshalls/etc. The ""fast"" seasonal sections of target and others are notorious for the really short rolls, so I avoid them || Go to many thrift stores. Eventually you‚Äôll find a department store donation of gift wrap. Let‚Äôs just hope it isn‚Äôt ugly.

What are your favorite BIFL items to put on our wedding registry?,"My fiance and I (early 30s, no house) are paradoxically not very materialistic but also VERY big into thrifting and picking. So while we don't want much, we already have a lot of the things people put on their wedding registries... like Le Creuset enamel dutch ovens, a stand mixer, a pretty lemonade pitcher, etc, that we picked up at estate sales for cheap. We basically see conventional shopping as a scam, get everything off eBay, don't support Amazon or Target, fast fashion, or plastic doohickeys. Its not easy for us to come up with a list of things we want, and THE CLOCK IS COUNTING DOWN!!!! I NEED TO GET SOME THINGS ON THIS REGISTRY!!!! I've been too scrappy for too long!

Its been genuinely hard for us to think of things to put on our registry. I'm like.... We could use new towels?

We don't own a home, and we've never been able to travel together, so we made a couple of ""funds"" people can contribute to, but I'm worried we'll look like assholes if our registry isn't more filled with objects to buy.

So PLEASE recommend things we might want that we are, for some reason, unable to think of on our own!

*(read on if you want more guidance or* ***just PLEASE dump your favorite BIFL things to have for marriage and adulthood!!!!!)***

**We like:** physical health, tunes, indoor gardening, surviving war or mass economic scarcity, cooking, baking, general health nut shit, things to take care of our things (idk, what's good for a car? a house? idk)

**We don't like:** alcoholism-as-hobby (ex. ""wine o'clock somewhere"" light up signs), super minimalist modern stuff, perpetual microplastic machines, and supporting technocrat oligarchs (we try not to ya know)

EDIT: Wow, I feel so lucky to have gotten such thoughtful responses. Thank you all for your time and expertise. Genuinely so helpful for me and my fiance. You guys are all so smart!!!!!!!!","Linen napkins, bed sets, and linen dish towels. A bidet. (GREAT gift for the best man to give)


Seed catalog gifts from David Austin Roses,¬† Lee Valley, Renees Garden.


An emergency first aid kit for each car, jumper cables, a 12 V battery charger, windshield shades.


Excellent suitcases. || My cousin did this and I thought it was great. Find a local ceramics artist that you like and ask if you can make some kind of registry with them. Eat off gorgeous handmade dishes until they are all broken and then thrift new ones. Added bonus, you support a local artist. Maybe find someone that also has beautiful plant pots. 

I also had a friend who registered for art from a local artist. 

Maybe you can register at your local nursery and get some super cool plants.

I think the point is your registry can be whatever you make it, look at it as an opportunity to support a local business and get something that you can hopefully use for awhile 


It‚Äôs supposed to be bad luck, but I registered for very high quality knives and am still using them 16 years later. || A quality brand of kitchen knives. Put them as individual items not a set.  Hinklels Wustoff and Kai Shun are all good choices.  The Wustoff classic knives I got for my wedding 25 years ago are still in use daily.

 A good food processor.  Like a Cuisinart 11 cups.  

Vitamix blender.

Stainless steel bowls.  

A boos cutting board || I prefer contributing to a honeymoon fund than buying stuff. 

My niece did one like a registry. We could contribute in increments of $25 so that it was reasonable. Items: Dinner at an expensive restaurant, tickets to a show, tickets to a sporting event, a horseback riding trial ride. || I was thinking about this recently! My friend got me Food Huggers (silicone food saver lid things) for my bridal shower and I use them all the time. I didn‚Äôt have them on my registry, but I like them a lot. They fit over half-eaten yogurt cups and lemons cut in half, etc.  

I also encourage you to just keep a short registry and get that $$$!  

Other ideas could be nice water bottles and those insulated can holders (Yeti, Thermoflask, Owala, etc). Or expensive things you can‚Äôt bring yourself to buy (such as a $100 Bogg bag). || Epicurian cutting boards. They last forever and don't get moldy like plastic or wood. || Nordic ware sheet pans in a variety of sizes. If you handwash them, you'll be passing them down to your heirs. I have from 1/8 sheet up to full sheet.

Wilton cupcake and cake pans

An extra bowl for your stand mixer

Cast iron pans, one standard size and 1-2 small ones (good for egg McMuffins, stovetop brownies, dips)

GOOD KNIVES. I'd search through the articles at The Strategist and pick out a few that make sense for the type of cooking you do. They list a broad variety of price ranges. 

Cutting boards, several small ones, at least one plastic one, and at least one large edge-grain wooden board

Good quality utensils, wooden ladles and spoons, solid silicon spatulas, whisks, strainers

Foundational cookbooks like Julia Child, Salt Fat Acid Heat, etc.

also if you like cooking it's fun to ask people to share a favorite recipe || A Peugeot pepper mill.
Make sure to splurge on the premium one with the adjustable grind. We loved ours so much that after 5 years, we bought a small combo set of salt and pepper mill in lieu of shakers for our table.


If definitely seems like our kids will inherit these.



Pepper Mills - Peugeot Saveurs https://share.google/QPPD6AUxlvMgcU79E || Congratulations!

Serveware if you like having people over for meals. In addition to linen napkins suggested above, tablecloth and runner for special occasions.

A nice vase for flowers

Outdoor furniture? (Not BIFL but something I have never been able to justify buying for myself)

Fire pit or chiminea

Nice hose and winder

Bird feeders and water feature

All Clad, Le Creuset anything, Lodge cast iron

Quality scissors like Kai or Gingher

Nice storage baskets in all sizes

Rice cooker, coffee or espresso machine, grinder, kettle

Nice throw blankets

Camping stuff? Tent, sleeping bags/pads, propane camp stove

Battery powered air compressor (game changer for filling your tires)

Power washer

Dremel tool

Fire extinguishers || We struggled with this for our registry too! Some of the most memorable things for us that have held up super well:
-Ninja grill (grills/air-fries/dehydrates/roasts/bakes! Easily use this everyday since it lowers the barrier to cook, doesn‚Äôt heat the whole kitchen, also easy to clean in dishwasher) 
-Instant pot 
-Electric water kettle (also daily! We‚Äôve gotten into looseleaf tea as a result)
-nice chefs knife
Also an early congratulations to you both! ü•Çüéâ || Bedding & towels for sure! || My favorite thing from our registry is our Juliska serveware. Microwave, oven, and dishwasher safe. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have coordinating serving dishes that I can prepare the food in and don‚Äôt have to wash by hand.

Also love the Zwilling chef‚Äôs knife a friend surprised us with.¬† || Air purifier-one with a washable filter

Darning kit and instruction book

Dehydrator¬†

Reference books. ¬† || Staub Cocottes and braisers. || A few ideas I had, not sure all of them fit the BIFL theme but:

- if you like reading, a copy of their favourite book - optional, ask them to sign it
- you mention you like tunes - similar to the above, some kind of copy (digital or otherwise) of their favourite album
- if you play a musical instrument, good quality copies of full works or concertos or nocturnes etc by your favourite composers
- contribution towards custom fit walking boots. Not fully BIFL, but many can be re-soled
- a canvas tent (eg a bell tent) (or a contribution towards). These things last years and are fabulous for camping¬†
- if you do like camping, various camping paraphernalia. If you go with the canvas tent you can get an awning, a stove, and other camping comforts
- if you like surviving war / mass economic scarcity, do you have your prep kits sorted? Do you have things stored in appropriate containers - could you ask for some of those?
- a good quality vacuum cleaner - Sebo or Miele.¬†
- a proper set of glass containers where everything all stacks and stores nicely. Ditch the plastic Tupperwares and disorganised mess that is many people‚Äôs food storage container situation
- home gym stuff, including stuff to eg upgrade the floor¬† || Ok, here's a BIFL pitch for Ryobi's 18v tool system. 

What separates Ryobi from the other tool brands is that they've kept the same battery design since 1996. They've upgraded the battery innards (to Lithium Ion from Nickel Cadmium) but the batteries are interchangable across the platform. And the platform is big - there are 300+ tools and gadgets currently on the platform. So Ryobi has basically promised that their batteries aren't going to succumb to planned obsolescence, which makes the system more sustainable then the others.

I suggest it because a) with good batteries, you can snag old Ryobi tools off of FB for cheap if you need them, b) they have an outdoor recreation line with things like Bluetooth speakers, misting fans, and bug zappers, c) If you become homeowners you can use the batteries for yard equipment and basic home maintenance, d) they're nice to have for basic life tools like emergency phone chargers, lights, and even car jumpers, and d) You can pair these batteries up to a specific solar charger to have some electricity on hand when the financial system and power grid collapse and you're left without meaningful infrastructure and you're forced to revert to an agrarian lifestyle. || Gift certificates to local businesses? (Where I live I would do things like the healthy feet shoe store, local artist collective that makes home stuff, hardware store, favorite plant store.)

Berkey Water filter (portable prepper-level filtration) || We decided to direct people at our wedding to give to Meals on Wheels. || If you two are coffee people - highly recommend the following:

What is the best electric toothbrush?,"My Aquasonic Black Series broke, which I really liked, and now I‚Äôm looking for something reliable to clean my teeth and braces. I‚Äôm deciding between oral b (rotating brush head, lots of people recommend it, kind of pricey?), sonicare (sonic technology, maybe cleans better?), and soocas (toothbrush and water flosser in one, feels like it might clean braces more thoroughly), or maybe you have other suggestions?

","I‚Äôve had a Sonicare diamond clean going on about 8 years. Nothing makes my mouth feel as clean after using and I‚Äôve tried multiple brands other than the expensive Oral-B. || I think the top 2 are Sonicare and Oral-B. The main difference between them is how the head moves. Oral-B has a rotating/spinning motion while the Sonicare has a vibration/back-and-forth motion.

I have heard that the smaller head of the Oral-B is better for hard to reach areas? Makes sense, but I don't know if that is that much different than the Sonicare.

I personally went with Sonicare and I have not regretted it. My brother praises his Oral-B.

In the end, the best toothbrush is the one you will actually use. || I haven‚Äôt used sonicare, but I‚Äôve tried both oral b and soocas. Honestly, I didn‚Äôt notice much difference in their basic brushing performance. But the water flosser that comes with soocas makes my teeth feel a lot cleaner after brushing. I used to use oral b plus regular floss, but now I just use soocas in the morning, at night, and after eating || Sonicare. I've had mine for about 7 years and it has changed my life.

It's ultimately down to preferance.

I've been Sonicare for over a decade, I really, really like it. As for recommendations, search this sub. You'll see that some days the sub considers Oral B the better buy whilst other days Sonicare is the sub's champion. || For braces, Oral-B‚Äôs rotating heads are great at getting around brackets. Sonicare feels gentler but can miss spots. Soocas combo‚Äôs handy, but I‚Äôd still keep a separate flosser. || I've been using an Oclean SE for 8 years and it still works perfectly. The battery life is amazing, I charge it twice a year || I like the new Oral-B. The heads are bigger, but I feel they clean better.

These are some of the easiest models to fix by yourself: ¬†Sonicare Series 5300/5500/6100/6500/7100 - youtube has plenty of videos on the topic || Honestly, just get a non electric one.

[Request] High quality stand up desk (preferably extra wide),"The number of stand up desk offerings has exploded over the past few years. Some are so cheap I have to assume they'll fall apart quickly.

I have no idea which brands are reputable, or if stand up desks by design are not ""buy it for life"" due to motors and light weight materials...

But I'd really love a wide stand up desk (3 monitors) that will last a while.

Any recommendations?","https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/idasen-desk-sit-stand-black-dark-gray-s79280998/

I got the large ID√ÖSEN electric standing desk from IKEA back around 2018, best desk I‚Äôve ever owned imo, though it hasn‚Äôt been super long it still stands as sturdy as when I got it, even with my 3 monitor/work set up and almost daily extended use. Though I will say looking at it now the price has gone up substantially, I got it for around $600 and it‚Äôs now up to $800. || I‚Äôve had my Fully standing desk for six years now and it looks and functions pretty much the same as it was new, and it‚Äôs very wide. I work from home so I use it daily. I‚Äôve also made at least three moves with it which means dissembling, re-assembling, putting it in storage, getting moved across state lines, etc, and it took all of that with no problem. || Build your own.

Get a flexispot E5 and then get a butcher block counter, or just get one of their options (up to 78x30)

I have a 74x40 butcher block desk with this combo.

They are dual motor and have a 280lb capacity, as well as memory presets. || VIVO makes decent ones, at least in the L-shaped three-motor variety. || I first got my [ConSet](https://conset.eu/) standing desk about 15 years ago and I've used it nearly every day since then (fulltime WFH for about 12 of those 15 years). I replaced the melamine top with an Ikea solid wooden table top of just the right size for me (now with 2 x 43"" 4K screens) after a few years, and the frame and the motor etc have been rock solid (and you can buy just the frame and motor for some desks).

One thing to consider is the ability to move it even slightly (eg for wiring) - I got one with [two column legs](https://conset.eu/product/default.aspx?m=search&id=0&o=frames&topcolor=&toptype=&framecolor=S-G&frametype=2-col) and a cross beam as it seemed more stable that way, but some I think also had slightly recessed wheels on the back of the feet and that might have been a good idea to make it easier to pull the desk out from the wall by a couple of feet to attach monitor arms etc || I‚Äôve had my steel case for 5 years which I got used in 2020 after my office closed. It‚Äôd been in my office for at least another five years.

Absolutely no issues. ¬† || I got one from Titan Fitness at the start of COVID. The frame is made with the same quality as their weight lifting equipment (which might not be Rogue quality, but it's more than good enough for a standing desk). The hardware can almost all be replaced at Ace hardware. The top is separate and replaceable. You can make your own out of plywood if you wanted. || [https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-46-in-W-x-24-in-D-2-Drawer-Adjustable-Height-White-Worktable-with-Solid-Wood-Top-HOLT4602BJ2/312063246?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&gStoreCode=1286&gQT=1](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-46-in-W-x-24-in-D-2-Drawer-Adjustable-Height-White-Worktable-with-Solid-Wood-Top-HOLT4602BJ2/312063246?source=shoppingads&locale=en-US&gStoreCode=1286&gQT=1)

  
Husky Worktable. Not technically a desk but it's super heavy duty and I've been using it daily since 2020 and it's still good as new. My friend has one and outfitted a drill bit in place of the hand crank to raise and lower it at a greater speed. They have different sizes, but I fit three monitors and a laptop on mine with plenty of space. || Limber desks are superb.  From lying to standing, no motors, sustainable and very well built.  I have one, worth every cent. || I got 1 from Autonomous about 12 years ago. Still going strong. I bought the stand mechanism with 2 motors and put a butcher block top on it just like another user did. || I bought a table made from an old barn door and then attached legs to it.

Tiny coffee gadgets that make a big difference?,"I‚Äôm a sucker for well-designed, durable coffee tools. Things like the Porlex grinder, Timemore scale, and recently the OutIn Nano. It‚Äôs self-contained and rechargeable, so it‚Äôs perfect for hiking trips. It‚Äôs not indestructible, but it's held up better than I expected.

Curious what other long-lasting coffee tools people swear by?","Many would put an Aeropress or Clever dripper in this category.¬† || I keep it simple at home. 

oxo coffee grinder, Moccamaster Brewer.

If I want coffee more complex than that then I make a trip to a coffee shop. || Wacoco picopresso makes solid espresso, no battery, all hand pumping.  Might be more reliable (and def lighter) than something electric.

Haven't researched what is new in a while, so maybe something better is available now, but this little machine is very solid and works quite well.

Edit:
Also Kalita Wave for pourovers.... metal, should last a lifetime, small and light.... || The very simple pour overs (hario, malita, etc etc) are all things that would last until you broke them. I have had two hario v60s over the past 16 years. One‚Äôs handle broke because I dropped it in the sink but after sanding the sharp edge (after cutting myself on it) it still *works*, just annoying.

The thing I got recently that I love is a small scale meant for small measurements. Overloads at 500g. Great for getting quick, accurate measurements of tiny things. I have a BIFL bigger scale I use when I need like, 800g of flour, but for everything else I just use the little guy.

And of course shout out to the aeropress. I could see maybe eventually needing to replace the plunger part? Maybe?

I feel like the coffee world is (thankfully) chock full of durable, very-long-lasting, quality stuff and it isn‚Äôt always even expensive. || Likely not as fancy as you‚Äôre seeking, but I got a collapsible silicone pour over for my luggage (those in-room machines are rarely cleaned). 

It should last the rest of my days. || Stainless steel scoops, measuring scoops--

Having trouble finding quality sneakers,"I am in need of sneakers again and I am finding myself frustrated but the big brands.

I gravitate to the Samba style: low profile, leather

I just can't do it again.

They last maybe a year and I am super sick of the repetition.

Anyone know a good way to search for different (unique) shoe manufacturers? I will also accept any recommendations. Frankly, I will spend what is necessary for a shoe I want/like.

Cheers!","The Samba ADV is better built than the Samba OG || Look into the YouTube channel Rose Anvil; the guy cuts shoes in half and shows you the material. There are some better-made sneakers, but they're limited. || The issue is they are being worn daily, they need to rest. You need two pairs of shoes so they have time to dry out. Shoes will never be buy it for life. || I have a few pairs of onitsuka tigers that are about 10 years old, I‚Äôve worn them walking miles through cities and for all sorts of travel. Still holding up fantastic || New Balance made in USA/England. || Onitsuka Tigers are cool. Its just sneakers aren't really buy it for life. If you wear them daily, then they only last a year. Best to have like 4-6 pairs you can always swap around. I even have a beater pair I like to wear when I dont wanna wear out the newer pairs. || Feel you on the Samba fatigue - they're everywhere now and the quality isn't what it used to be.

For that low profile leather vibe, check out:

* Veja V-10 or Esplar - sustainable, well-made, different aesthetic
* Common Projects Achilles - minimal, premium leather, lasts forever
* Maison Margiela GATs - basically elevated Sambas with better materials
* Onitsuka Tiger Mexico 66 - retro vibes, solid construction

For finding unique brands, honestly just browse End Clothing, Mr Porter, or Norse Store - they carry tons of smaller European sneaker brands you won't see everywhere.

Also try searching ""German Army Trainers"" or ""court shoe alternatives"" - you'll find brands like Reproduction of Found, Shoes Like Pottery, etc.

What's your budget? That'll help narrow down recommendations. || Google ‚ÄúGat‚Äù or ‚Äúgerman military surplus trainers‚Äù. I can‚Äôt remember if the Samba came before or after, but you can find them online and they have the same sole pattern.

I wouldn‚Äôt say they‚Äôre truly but it for life bc most sneakers will never last that long, but a buddy of mine was a pair that‚Äôs he‚Äôs wore for about 5+ years || I used to wear shoes like this‚Ä¶ or Pumas‚Ä¶ now my favorite shoe company is ‚ÄúPiloti‚Äù.

It took me awhile to place my first order because I was like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need *driving* shoes‚Äù but now I literally have 4-5 pairs and it‚Äôs all I wear. 

Specifically, I recommend you try a pair of the ‚ÄúShift‚Äù in leather. They do have sales for most major holidays so most of my pairs I paid like $150ish for. || I‚Äôm not a sneaker person but I know Cheaney sell trainers. They make very good quality shoes.

https://www.cheaney.co.uk/men-c48/trainers-c108 || The issue is you're looking for sneakers. Sports shoes, especially sneakers, are designed to be comfortable immediately with minimal breaking in, and to last as long as the support lasts - if you are entirely sedentary you might get a decade out of them, but really you should be wearing through most sneakers within a few years, less than that if you wear them every day. For shoes that last you need more solid styles, leather boots with good soles that won't be as light and comfy and will need proper breaking in.

Agree with everyone else your best bet is finding a pair you like and that lasts as long as possible then rotating wears between a couple of then and your other shoes. || No sneaker is BIFL. || I would recommend the Stan Smith Lux. It's real leather instead of those plastic-y leather.

It's not too expensive either. I got the the classic green/white one. || If you still like adidas their skate shoes are way more durable. The original busenitz and especially the Tyshawn lows. Take a while to break in and you might not like the toe design but I‚Äôve dailied those for years. My first pair is over 5 years old now and they still look and feel good. They mold to your foot just like the soccer shoes but they are way tougher. Sambas go to shit after a while. || Skolyx. They have amazing sneaker care guides, too || PUMAs, yes. || I recently bought my first pair of Brooks from one of those shoe stores that measure your foot width , gait, and all that jazz. Previously, I only wore chucks or doc martens. But I'm never going back after wearing these for a couple months! Check em out. There's a few other brands they presented, but Brooks is what I ended up going with and I don't regret it at all. || They are kinda hard to find, but Hartjes is the best leather sneaker style shoe I have ever had. I wore my last pair for like 14 years walking a couple miles a day many days and the bottom finally wore through. But the leather still looked great. I bought a replacement pair and had them sent to the US from Switzerland. Totally. Worth it. || Xero Shoes are actually pretty damn wel constructed.
